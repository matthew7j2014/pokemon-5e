## Sawyer
Trainer: Sawyer
Age: 17
End Goal: Johto Gym Leader

Sawyer grew up in the sleepy, snow-dusted Mahogany Town of Johto, where the chill of the Ice Path loomed large over the community. As a kid, he was restless, feeling trapped by the town’s quiet routine. At 12, while exploring the outskirts, he stumbled across an abandoned Eevee, shivering in the snow with a tattered scarf around its neck. Sawyer took it in, naming it Flicker, and the two became inseparable, their bond built on mutual trust and a shared itch for something bigger. Flicker’s adaptability sparked Sawyer dream: to become a Gym Leader in Johto and make its gyms a force so formidable that no one would ever call the region “second-rate” again.

Johto’s gyms, often overshadowed by Kanto’s prestigious Pokémon League, were dismissed by outsiders as charming but weak. Sawyer, fiercely proud of his home, vowed to change that perception. He set out for Kanto, the epicenter of Pokémon battling, to sharpen his skills and learn from its legendary trainers. Unlike most trainers, Sawyer embraced versatility, seeing Flicker’s potential to evolve in countless ways as a symbol of his own refusal to be boxed in. His goal: return to Johto, claim a gym—perhaps even Mahogany’s—and build a legacy that showcases the region’s untapped strength.
### Jett
Name: Jett Calder
Trainer Path: Ranger
Specialization: Swimmer
Backstory: Jett is a 21-year-old Pokémon Ranger, who was born and raised on the sun-scorched shores of Cinnabar Island in the Kanto region. Growing up in the shadow of the island’s fierce fire gym leader Blaine, Jett was always drawn to the ocean’s edge rather than the fire’s warm beckon. His parents, marine researchers studying the migratory patterns of Water-type Pokémon, instilled in him a deep respect for the sea and its creatures. As a child, Jett would spend hours snorkeling in the shallows, befriending curious Horsea and playful Lapras that frequented Cinnabar’s coastal waters.
During his teenage years, Jett’s adventurous spirit led him to the nearby Seafoam Islands, where he honed his survival skills. With little more than a tent, a fishing rod, and his trusty partner, a Poliwag he named Tide, Jett learned to navigate the islands’ icy caves, read tidal patterns, and thrive in the wild. He spent countless nights camping under the stars, forging bonds with the sea’s inhabitants like Seel and Krabby, who taught him the rhythms of the ocean. These experiences shaped Jett into a skilled survivalist, adept at reading nature’s signs—whether it’s predicting a storm by the behavior of Pidgey or finding fresh water by tracking Staryu migrations.
Now, at 21, Jett is ready to embark on his first true Pokémon adventure as a Ranger, driven by a mission to protect the natural habitats of the Water-type Pokémon of Kanto and beyond. Unlike traditional trainers chasing badges, Jett’s goal is to explore uncharted wilds, rescue Pokémon in distress, and restore balance to ecosystems threatened by human activity. With Tide at his side, Jett sets out with a waterproof pack, a hand-carved driftwood staff, and an unshakable bond with the sea, ready to face whatever challenges the world throws his way.
### Bull Gates
The Rise and Redemption of Bull Gates the Heavy Leg: A Pokémon Trainer's Journey
Bull Maximilian Gates III was born with a silver Pokéball in his mouth, heir to the Gates Digital Storage Empire - the company that revolutionized how trainers manage their Pokémon collections. His father, Bull Gates Senior (known in business circles as "Big Bull"), had built his fortune on the Gates Storage System, a revolutionary technology that could compress Pokéball data into microscopic storage units. The family motto, emblazoned on their corporate headquarters, read "Size Doesn't Matter - It's How You Use Your Storage."
From an early age, young Bull displayed an unusual relationship with technology that his tutors couldn't quite explain. While other children struggled to understand basic Pokédex functions, Bull seemed to commune with digital devices as if they were living creatures. He would place his hands on computers and somehow know exactly what data they contained, leading his governess to whisper that the boy had "unnatural intuition." His father, ever the pragmatist, simply assumed his son had inherited the family's legendary business instincts.
Bull's adolescence at the prestigious Silph Academy for Young Entrepreneurs was marked by both academic excellence and social controversy. His classmates nicknamed him "Heavy Leg" after an incident during a school presentation about "maximizing your Pokémon's potential." While demonstrating what he called his "penetrating analysis technique," Bull gestured enthusiastically about "getting deep into your Pokémon's core systems" and "finding their most sensitive pressure points for optimal performance." The way he strutted around the classroom, combined with his habit of making everything sound vaguely suggestive, earned him a reputation that he seemed to relish rather than discourage.
The young Gates developed a particular fascination with what he termed "hard data extraction" and frequently boasted about his ability to "interface with any system, no matter how tight the protocols." His professors were never quite sure if he was discussing computer programming or something else entirely, especially when he would wink while explaining his "hands-on approach to achieving maximum output." His senior thesis, titled "Penetrating the Mysteries of Pokémon-Trainer Synchronization Through Deep Mental Insertion," raised eyebrows throughout the academic community, though no one could deny its technical brilliance.
The First Connection: Meeting Processor
The moment that would change Bull's life forever occurred during what he initially considered just another boring corporate obligation. Big Bull had dragged his son to Saffron City for a merger meeting with the Psychic-type Gym, hoping to integrate their mental training techniques with the Gates Storage System for what he called "intuitive data management." Bull, dressed in his finest suit and armed with a briefcase full of contracts promising "maximum satisfaction for all parties involved," swaggered into the gym expecting to close another easy deal.
The Gym Leader, Sabrina, greeted them with polite but distant professionalism. As she led them through the facility's rehabilitation center, Bull couldn't help but comment loudly about the "impressive mental facilities" and how he was "looking forward to getting deep into their operations." Several staff members exchanged uncomfortable glances, but Bull remained oblivious to their discomfort, too busy calculating profit margins and planning his victory celebration.
That's when he saw the small Abra huddled alone in the corner of the recovery room, completely motionless except for the occasional twitch of its fox-like ears. Sabrina explained that this particular Pokémon had been abandoned by three different trainers who found it "unresponsive to conventional training methods." The Abra had retreated so far into its own mind that it barely acknowledged the physical world, spending eighteen hours a day in what appeared to be deep meditation.
Bull's business instincts immediately kicked in. Here was a defective product that others had foolishly discarded, probably worth acquiring at a significant discount. He approached the Abra with his usual confidence, announcing that he had "never met a system he couldn't penetrate" and that he would "show this little guy what real deep connection feels like." The staff watched nervously as Bull reached out his hand toward the psychic Pokémon, fully expecting to demonstrate his superior interfacing abilities.
What happened next was unlike anything Bull had ever experienced. The moment his fingers came within inches of the Abra's head, a surge of pure mental energy crashed into his consciousness like a tidal wave. Suddenly, Bull found himself experiencing not just the Abra's thoughts, but its memories, emotions, and deepest fears. He felt the crushing loneliness of being abandoned repeatedly, the frustration of trying to communicate with trainers who saw him only as a tool, and the profound sadness of a highly intelligent being treated as nothing more than a malfunctioning piece of equipment.
The psychic connection was so overwhelming that Bull stumbled backward, his carefully styled hair disheveled and his expensive suit wrinkled. For the first time in his privileged life, he had encountered something that couldn't be bought, programmed, or dominated through sheer force of personality. The Abra's mind was vast, ancient, and completely unimpressed by Bull's material advantages or crude humor. More importantly, Bull realized with growing horror that his own thoughts and intentions had been laid bare during the connection. The Abra had seen through his arrogant facade and witnessed the loneliness and insecurity he kept hidden beneath layers of wealth and bravado.
Instead of the usual business-like dismissal Bull expected, the Abra opened one golden eye and regarded him with what seemed almost like curiosity. In that moment, Bull understood that this Pokémon hadn't been unresponsive to previous trainers because it was defective, but because it was incredibly intelligent and had simply chosen not to waste its energy on relationships that offered no genuine connection or respect.
Bull's initial reaction was typically crude. He straightened his tie, cleared his throat, and announced that he had "successfully established a deep mental link" and was "ready for full synchronization." But as he spoke, he could feel the Abra's gentle amusement at his transparent attempt to regain control of the situation. The psychic Pokémon had seen past his bluster to the genuine fascination and, surprisingly, the beginning of real respect that Bull was trying to hide.
Over the following weeks, Bull found himself returning to the gym not for business meetings, but simply to sit near the Abra and attempt to understand the nature of their connection. His usual attempts at impressive conversation fell flat when directed at a creature who could read his actual thoughts and intentions. Gradually, Bull began to drop his performative persona and simply be present with the Pokémon, sharing honest thoughts about his confusion, his genuine interest in psychic phenomena, and his growing awareness that he had been approaching relationships as transactions rather than connections.
The breakthrough came when Bull finally stopped trying to impress the Abra and instead asked, through their tentative mental link, what the Pokémon actually wanted. The answer was startlingly simple: respect, understanding, and a partner who valued intelligence over obedience. Bull realized that his previous approach to everything, from business deals to personal relationships, had been based on dominance and control rather than mutual benefit and genuine care.
The day Bull officially adopted the Abra, whom he named Processor in a moment of uncharacteristic humility, marked the beginning of his transformation from entitled heir to genuine trainer. Their partnership started awkwardly, with Bull still making inappropriate jokes about their "mental connection" and "synchronized thinking," but Processor seemed to find his trainer's crude humor endearing rather than offensive, especially since the psychic link allowed the Abra to sense the genuine affection and respect beneath Bull's clumsy expressions.
As their bond strengthened, Bull discovered that his psychic abilities weren't just enhanced versions of his technological skills, but entirely new ways of understanding and connecting with other beings. Processor became not just his starter Pokémon, but his teacher, patiently helping Bull learn to communicate through empathy rather than manipulation, and to value connection over conquest. The arrogant young man who had once boasted about his ability to "penetrate any system" gradually evolved into someone who understood that the most meaningful relationships required vulnerability, respect, and genuine care for the other party's wellbeing.
This partnership between the wealthy heir and the abandoned psychic Pokémon became the foundation for Bull's eventual reputation as a trainer who could bridge the gap between technological innovation and genuine emotional intelligence, proving that even the most privileged beginnings could lead to authentic growth and meaningful connections.
### Gin
Backstory: Gin's dream is to be a pokemon professor just like his adoptive father, Professor Rowan. Gin has lived in Sandgem town in the Sinnoh region for most of his life. Gin's mother was Professor Rowan's assistant but unfortunately passed away in an accident when he was young and his father was never in the picture. To this day Gin has no idea his father is the leader of Team Rocket, Giovanni. While Gin knows Professor Rowan isn't his father, he still is proud to be called his son. Though he does mess with him some and calls him "Gramps".

Gin has gone with the professor on many research trips and has gained a deep appreciation and love for pokemon. Along with this, his deep respect for Gramps is what has driven Gin to become a pokemon professor. Gin loves learning about the ecology and habitats of pokemon and has been one of the main areas of his studies.

Gin is fairly personable and easy to get along with, but does have a few bad habits, specifically when it comes to pokemon. Most of the time when he sees a new pokemon he has a habit of geeking out and ignoring everything else around him when he sees it. His easy going attitude can also quickly change to a more harsh demeanor when he sees someone hurting a pokemon or its habitat. It's also one of the reasons why he doesn't love having pokemon battles himself, even though he is surprisingly adept at them.

After officially working under Professor Rowan for the past 4 years, Gramps decided for Gin's 22nd birthday to send him to work under his friend and colleague, Professor Oak.  Gin had met Professor Oak a couple of times over the years and was excited for the opportunity to study under him. A few weeks later Gin arrives in Pallet Town eager to learn more about the pokemon of the Kanto region.
# Act 1: The Pallet Town Incident

## **Opening Hook: Why Are the PCs Here?**

**The Research Volunteer Program:** Professor Oak sent out a region-wide call for "research assistants" to help with a special project studying unusual Pokémon behavior patterns across Kanto. Each PC responded for their own reasons:

- **Jett Calder** – A local ranger and field researcher with a deep connection to Water-types and environmental protection.
- **Sawyer Ford** – An aspiring Gym Leader from Johto who never received a formal starter and wants to prove Johto's strength.
- **Mike OxBig** – A bold trainer and Pokémon collector, hoping to catch every legendary and pseudo-legendary.
- **Gin** – A research student from Sinnoh, working under Oak after training with Professor Rowan.
- **Bull Gates** – Heir to the Gates Storage System empire; seeking redemption through a real psychic bond with his Pokémon.

## **Opening Scene: Outside Oak’s Lab (10–15 minutes)**

_The sun rises over the rooftops of Pallet Town, painting the clouds gold and pink. A soft breeze rolls through the quiet village, stirring the grass along the well-trodden dirt path that leads north — toward the wilds of Route 1._
_It’s peaceful here. A few Pidgey coo from a rooftop. Somewhere, a Krabby scuttles across the dock. The rest of Kanto may be bustling, but here in Pallet, things usually move slowly._
_Except today._
_Today, the city is buzzing with excitement. Professor Oak’s lab at the south end of town hums with energy. The windows flicker with blue light. Machines buzz faintly behind the walls. A faded banner hangs from a nearby lamppost:_

**“Welcome to Pallet Town”**

_Five trainers now stand at the foot of that path — some just arriving, others waiting. You’ve never met before. But for reasons only you know… you’ve all answered the same call._
_As the players are mid-conversation — swapping names, hometowns, or eyeing each other warily — the front door to the lab hisses open._
_A lab aide steps out, a tall woman with long brown hair and glass. She has a clipboard in hand, and adjusts her glasses as she scans the small group._

**Lab Aide:** _“Hello! My name is Amy, I am one of Professor Oak’s lab assistants. You must be the volunteers he has been so excited about.”_

_She looks up and starts counting heads, tapping the clipboard._
_“Let’s see here. I just need to confirm your names before we bring you in. It’s been a bit hectic this morning—Pokémon migration patterns, data scrambles, someone spilled Moomoo Milk on the terminal again... anyway!”_
_She seems friendly but is a little frazzled._
_“Name, region, and maybe a fun fact? The professor likes to keep things… informal.”_

Once everyone is done, the aide can usher them into the lab with something like:

_“Great, that’s everyone. Please, follow me inside, the professor has some things he needs from you before he arrives.”_

## **The Lab Session**

_As the lab doors slide open, the space buzzes with academic energy. Shelves packed with journals, softly humming monitors, and the scent of antiseptic and berries fill the air. Amy leads you inside._
_“Before you meet the professor, he’s asked you all to jump into some hands-on prep work. Think of it as a warm-up.”_
_The aide points to 2 doors to the east and west in the lab._ 

### **Pokéball Sorting Scene**

_The aide leads you into a room on the west side of the laboratory. As you enter the room, you find a clean, well-lit workstation surrounded by labeled display boxes, each with a different habitat symbol etched into the lid — a leafy green sprout, a jagged mountain silhouette, a drop of water, a blazing sun, and a red warning triangle._
_On the nearby table are five unmarked Pokéballs, resting in a soft-lined tray. A monitor above the station flickers to life, briefly showing scanned data: species silhouettes, location pings, and brief behavioral notes._
_A young lab aide in a crisp coat glances up from their tablet and smiles._
_“This is Station One — Pokéball Sorting. These five Pokémon were just logged, but their transport balls got shuffled. Think you can figure out which one belongs in which box?”_
_They gesture to the display cases behind them._
_“Match the Pokémon to its natural environment. You’ll have to rely on clues with the Pokeball to determine this. Don’t worry—no one gets it perfect the first time… well, except maybe Professor Oak.”_
_The aide gestures to five color-coded bins behind the table, each labeled with a different tag:_

_A. Grassland Pokémon\
B. Cave Dwellers\
C. Aquatic Species\
D. Hot Climate Pokémon\
E. Temperamental / Requires Sedation_

_He points to a set of tools laid out beside the Pokéballs — a scale, a scent reader, an infrared scanner, and a reference notebook._

**Lab Aide:**

_“You can use any tools you like. Each of you pick a ball. The goal is to match each ball to their respective box. After all of the balls have been placed, you press this green button to submit.”_
Each ball has subtle clues (below). Players may **inspect** them using **Investigation (INT).** Have each player make a DC investigation check on one ball.

#### **Pokéball 1: Faint Claw Marks + Earthy Scent**

- **Clues:** There are tiny claw scratches near the button. The ball smells faintly of soil. There's a small leaf-shaped etching on the base.
- **Pokémon:** **Sandshrew**
- **Correct Bin:** **B. Cave Dwellers**

#### **Pokéball 2: Warm to the Touch + Slight Singe**

- **Clues:** Warm surface. A small wisp of smoke escapes when it's jostled. Scorch marks near latch.
- **Pokémon:** **Growlithe**
- **Correct Bin:** **D. Hot Climate Pokémon**

#### **Pokéball 3: Wet Exterior + Smell of Salt**

- **Clues:** Dripping with condensation. Smells of saltwater. Emits a low hum when near metal.
- **Pokémon:** **Goldeen**
- **Correct Bin:** **C. Aquatic Species**

#### **Pokéball 4: Twitching Slightly + Faint Muffled Buzzing**

- **Clues:** The Pokéball shakes periodically. Buzzing comes from inside. A faded black sticker with a lightning bolt is barely visible.
- **Pokémon:** **Magnemite**
- **Correct Bin:** **E. Temperamental/Requires Sedation**

#### **Pokéball 5: Green Smudge + Faint Vine Scratch + Floral Scent**

- **Clues:** Smudged with green. Has a faint vine etching along the ridge. Smells like raw Pecha berries.
- **Pokémon:** **Oddish**
- **Correct Bin:** **A. Grassland Pokémon**

#### **End:** 

Once all balls are placed in a bin, the group can press a button to submit their choices.

#### **Rewards:**

**Lab Aide:**

_“Excellent work! The Professor will be excited to have heard of your success at this station today. For this, I will reward each of you with your own custom pokeball! The professor mentioned that they have some special attributes and that you will need to wait until you use them to see what they are. Now, shall you head over to station 2?”_

- **5/5 Correct:** The lab aide is impressed. Each PC is granted a **bonus custom Pokéball** (flavor appearance).

#### WHAT ACTUALLY HEPPENED

The group successfully figured out the correct bins for the balls. Bull got the Fire pokeball, Jett got the water pokeball, Sawyer got the tempermental pokeball, Gin got the grassland pokeball, Mike got the Cave Dweller pokeball.
## **Pokémon Recovery Ward**

_Any leads the group to the east side of the laboratory. The room is quiet, the kind of hush found in Pokémon Centers at night. Recovery pens softly hum with vitals monitors, and the aide gestures to three injured Pokémon, each needing care. There are cabinets nearby with basic supplies: Potions, berries, bandages, gauze, herbs, and eye droppers._

**Lab Aide:**

_“These pokemon have been brought to us for seemingly odd injuries. The pokemon center in Viridian City sent them here for us to try to figure out why their injuries aren’t healing with conventional medicinal practices. Your job is to help determine what the injuries may have been caused by and how we can heal them. Please feel free to collaborate together on these and use any tools you see in the cabinets.”_

### **Pokémon Patients**

#### **1. Sandshrew — Clawed Forelimb + Limp**

**Visible Symptoms:**

- Bandaged forelimb
- Avoids using front paw
- Flinches when approached from the right

**Skill Checks:**

- **DC 12:** _The paw isn’t just sprained—it appears to have been_ **_twisted forcefully_** _in the wrong direction. This wasn’t from digging or wild combat_.
- **DC 16+:**_. You find subtle residue near the wrist joint—fine grey grit that doesn’t match local soil. Maybe this is why potions are ineffective?_  **Potion reward**
- **DC 20+:** Read DC 16 to PC - **Note crit success. Maybe hook in later.**

**Roleplay Clues:**

- Sandshrew responds positively to gentle touch, buries face in a dry **Oran berry** if offered.
- Winces when hearing metal clinks (like Pokéball latches).

#### **2. Oddish — Labored Breathing + Leaf Discoloration**

**Visible Symptoms:**

- Dull, dark leaves
- Breathes with faint wheezing
- A small yellow crust near roots

**Skill Checks:**

- **DC 12:** _You notice that Oddish turns its leaves slowly toward light, but retracts as it gets close to light._
- **DC 16+:** _You notice the leaf texture is unusually stiff and you see singe marks—not just sick, but possibly chemically_ **_burned_**_. You suspect that a foreign irritant is present._ **Potion reward.**
- **DC 20+:** _Scraping some residue and sniffing it, you notice a faint synthetic musk._ **Note crit success. Maybe hook in later.**

#### **3. Pidgey — Refuses to Fly + Bruised Wing**

**Visible Symptoms:**

- Left wing slightly raised, not used
- Sits in corner with rapid eye movement
- Ruffled feathers along spine

**Skill Checks:**

- **DC 12:** _You notice the pidgey’s wing is not moving. Also, its eyes are darting side to side more rapidly than normal._
- **DC 16+:** _The bruising follows a_ **_netting pattern_**_—not blunt trauma, but force from_ **_a restraint tool_**_, like a capture net_. _Also it appears the Pidgey is perhaps having a panic attack from potentially being captured._ **Potion reward.**
- **DC 20+:** _You part the feathers gently and find a faint_ **_scarred ring_** _where a lightweight restraint band was previously attached._ **Note crit success. Maybe hook in later.**

#### **Rewards:**

**Lab Aide:**

_“Again - excellent work! The nurses in Viridian City will be relieved to see these pokemon feeling better. We will pass your findings to them as well so they will be better suited for caring for these types of injuries going forward. For this, I will reward each of you with a potion and antidote. I think soon the professor should be ready to greet you if you’d follow me back into the main laboratory._

#### WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

The party solved the issues for the hurt pokemon and got the rewards

## **Professor Oak's Address (Before the Attack)**

_Does anyone want to do or say anything while waiting for the professor to enter?_
_Professor Oak enters the lab with a warm smile, gently brushing some dust from his coat sleeve as he walks toward the group. His eyes sweep across the lab to the 2 workstation doors and the busy aides. There’s an undeniable presence to him. Not just the man behind decades of Pokémon research, but the man every trainer in Kanto seems to reference like a myth:_
_He’s a living legend, and yet—he carries none of the ego. Just clarity in his eyes and that same inquisitive spark he had on the cover of Pokémon Research Monthly._
_He stops beside the group, hands clasped behind his back. “Ah, the volunteer team. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you.” He smiles with genuine warmth._
_“Today may feel like a routine lab day… but don’t be fooled. Understanding Pokémon—really understanding them—isn’t about fame or battles. It’s about curiosity, empathy, and getting your hands a little dirty.”_
_“First of all, thank you — truly — for answering the call. Each of you comes from different parts of Kanto and beyond, and you’ve brought something valuable with you: perspective.”_
_He moves towards his desk at the back of the lab as he continues to talk._
_“The world is changing. Wild Pokémon are behaving strangely. Ecosystems we’ve studied for decades are shifting — faster than we can understand. And while some in the L_eague _see this as a mere curiosity… I see a warning sign.”_

**Have the PCs make an insight check here. See if they notice that it seems that the professor is hiding something. Maybe he isn’t giving the whole truth here, but sugar coating it out of worry.**

_He turns toward the group, folds his arms behind his back, his voice thoughtful._
_“That’s why I started this program. Not just to analyze symptoms, but to train people who will ask the right questions — and care about the answers.”_
_He gives a nod toward the Recovery Ward._
_“I’ve spoken with my aides this morning — particularly about the Recovery Ward. There’ve been more cases of unprovoked aggression lately… and Pokémon showing signs of distress we’ve never seen before. Odd migratory shifts, abnormal medicinal needs for routine injuries. It’s like something’s affecting their instincts.”_
_He sighs, then smiles again._

**Have the PCs make a perception check here. The aids are slowly stopping what they are doing and looking around. See if the players notice.**

_“But that’s exactly why I brought you here. New eyes, new energy. I believe in the next generation of researchers and trainers. I believe in you. Now, why don’t we—”_
_CRASH!_
_And with that. Through the 8 windows of the lab comes 8 black grenade looking spheres. They land on the floor and explode into pink powder, something you have seen from pokemon before and know it as sleep powder.. Except, this looks thicker and is not from a pokemon._

### **The Sleep Gas Attack (15 minutes)**

**The Assault:**

- Windows shatter — eight black spheres crash through in a synchronized strike and emit sleeping power.
- PCs each get 1–2 actions before succumbing.
- The door is being jammed shut, you are not sure by what.

**Cinematic Fading Moments per PC:**


## **Sawyer:** __

_There’s ringing in your ears. Faint… pulsing… sharp. Your eyes flutter open for a moment._
_You're still on the ground. Everything's upside down—lights flickering overhead, the floor shaking with muffled footsteps. You can’t move._
_Through the swirl of gas and noise, you see movement—dark uniforms, red R’s. A few shapes duck through the smoke._
_Then something small._

**Have him make a perception check here to see how well he sees it.**

_A tail. A pair of wide, frightened eyes. Fur matted, scrambling against the grip of a gloved hand._

**_Eevee._**

_Not just any Eevee—_**_You recognize this one._**_._
_It lets out a panicked cry as it's pulled toward the lab exit, held by a Team Rocket grunt. One of the others barks, “Just grab the test subjects—leave the duds!”_
_Your lips try to move. You want to shout. To get up. But everything goes black again before you can even lift your arm._

### **The Aftermath: Awakening (30 minutes)**

**What the PCs Experience:**

_The haze begins to clear as you slowly regain consciousness. The lab is dim, flickering with emergency lights. The sound of hurried footsteps and clattering metal echoes in the distance. Through bleary eyes, you spot_ **_two black-clad Team Rocket operatives_** _rifling through drawers, yanking books off shelves, and dumping armfuls of research into bags._

**_One Rocket Grunt_**_:_ “Hurry it up! The boss wants everything from the migration files to Oak’s private logs — we’ve got to get out of here soon!”
**_Two Rocket Grunt_**_:_ “This is finally our big chance to get promoted! We need to get everything!”

_The 2 figures go back and forth about impressing the boss and are less worried about leaving quickly._
_You also notice several Pokémon in the room:_ **_Koffing, Ekans, Sandshrew_** _— all assisting in the looting. These Pokémon move jerkily, unnaturally._ **_Their eyes are hollow, glazed… void-like._** _Something about their demeanor is off. The team rocket operatives and their pokemon do not notice your presence._

## **Bull Gates**

_As you push yourself off the cold tile, five Poké Balls lay in a wide scatter—one rolled beneath an overturned cart, another still faintly glowing, but_ _your eye catches the side of one Poké Ball. It’s scorched and battered, but unmistakable—a_ **_Gates Digital_** _asset ID etched along its base. Faded but not erased. Your chest tightens. It seems to slowly roll towards you._
_You know this unit._ **_Unit A-BR-07_**_, prototype cognitive-loop subject. You worked on it once—watched it sleep inside a neural-sync tank deep in the server rooms of your father’s labs. You thought it was lost._
**Wait for the PC here.. Does he reach for the ball? Need to make a stealth check. Even on a failure, make them not be noticed.**
_When you reach for it, your PokéGear vibrates—a secure signal handshake. The Abra’s Poké Ball accepts your biometric signature. You remember a voice from your past_ - _“The best test subjects aren’t just responsive. They remember who touched them first.”_

**If Bull asks why Abra was here: Abra was being studied for _instant data relocation_—a prototype for teleporting Poké Balls or trainer memories. Team Rocket was trying to replicate this and failed to detect this unit.**

## **Jett Calder**

_You awaken to a dull ache in your chest and the sharp scent of acrid smoke. Your hand brushes against cold tile as you push yourself upright. Flickering lights above barely illuminate the shattered remains of what was once Professor Oak’s pristine lab._
_You remember the last thing said before the flashbangs—“Please place your Poké Balls in the containment tray before entering the testing room. Standard protocol.”_
_The tray._

**Ask what he wants to do here. Perception check to look for the ball?**

The containment tray is tipped over, dented from the blast. Several Poké Balls lie scattered across the floor—some cracked, others glowing faintly.
Your heart skips. A slim blue ring is etched around the equator of the one of the capsules—custom marine-seal casing. Waterproof, pressure-rated.
_You reach for it, hands trembling just slightly. As your fingers close around the familiar shell, it hums. You don’t even need to press the button. Poliwag. Tide. You remember the days spent training him by tidepools outside Cinnabar. Watching him swim rings around Staryu. The way he used to tap your shoulder with his tail when he wanted to play._ **_Tide stayed. Or maybe… he came back._** _Either way—he’s here. And he’s yours._

## **Gin**

_You come to slowly, your cheek pressed against the scorched tile. There’s no clarity—only the taste of ash and the low whine of flickering electronics._
_A metallic clatter snaps you into focus. You look up. You see Team Rocket operatives opening a containment drawer.  Poké Balls, scattered across the floor like marbles from a broken experiment. One of them... isn’t just lying still._
_It rolls gently across the floor, nudged by something invisible. It stops beside you. You reach for it. The label is smudged, but you make out some of it:_
_“Specimen #9B – Unusually responsive to external stimuli. Tracks handler movement when no stimuli present.” Curious. That specimen was overly attentive. Too focused._

**Ask him what he wants to do here. Does he want to open it? He doesn’t remember what pokemon is inside.**

_When you open the ball,_ **_Bellsprout materializes_** _in a twist of green and gold._
_It stands quietly. Tilts its head. Looks directly at you. Then walks forward, placing a leafy tendril on your hand. Your pulse catches. For all your data, your charts, your notes..._ **_you didn’t record this._**
_A bond. Not measured. Not synthesized. Just present._
_Bellsprout doesn’t speak. But something in the way it leans toward you—like a vine reaching for light—says enough:_
_“I picked you.”_

## **Mike**

_The crash. The smoke. The alarms. All of it fades as your eyes snap open. Your jacket’s scorched. There’s glass in your hair. And for one horrifying second—you think you're back in the water._
_Slateport Bay. That shipwreck. The thunder. You sit up fast, heart pounding. But this isn’t the sea. It’s Professor Oak’s lab— or at least what’s left of it._
_You groan, brushing ash from your shirt. Your eyes catch a tray upended near the wall, with Poké Balls spilled across the floor. One of them is sparking._

**Ask if he wants to grab the pokeball? If so, he needs to make a stealth check.**

_You grab it. It’s warm._

**Does he want to open it?**

_When you press the button, a flash of light explodes in front of you—and lands on four legs._

**_Growlithe._**

_It snarls at first, fangs bared. Smoke wafts from its mouth. But then it sees you—smoke-stained, bruised—and its ears lower. It steps forward. Licks your hand once. You stare at it. “You stayed?” you ask. It barks. Sharp. Fierce._
_And suddenly something flickers inside you. A fire you haven’t felt since the day that blizzard swallowed your ship whole.You remember talons of ice. Feathers like a storm. The moment you knew the world was bigger than you._

**If Mike let’s growlithe out, roll initiative because of the bark alerting team rocket.**

## **Sawyer**

_You wipe the blood from your lip. You don’t even remember getting hit. Smoke still curls through the air. Static crackles from shattered terminals. You’re on your knees in the middle of the lab, teeth clenched, eyes locked on the door they dragged her through._

**_Flicker._**

_You swear you saw him—tail flashing, ears pinned, struggling against that Rocket grunt’s grip. You’d tried to move, tried to shout… but the gas hit first. You blacked out. Now he’s gone._
_A clatter interrupts your spiral._
_One of the scattered Poké Balls nearby begins to roll—slowly, aimlessly, like something inside is stirring. You glare at it. "Not now." It bumps into your foot. Stops. The light flashes, flickers, and goes out. It stops moving by your feet._

**Ask if he wants to grab the pokeball?**

_You grab it. It almost feels like it’s rumbling._

**Does he want to open it?**

_The light flashes, and out steps a short, stocky figure—gray skin, sharp eyes, fists already clenched._ **_Machop._** _It looks around at the wreckage, then at you. It walks up and punches you in the leg. Not hard. Not mean. Just… enough._
_You meet its gaze. There’s no pity in its eyes. No sympathy. Just readiness._

## **Resolution**

**When the Rockets flee:**

- Smoke Bombs detonate, obscuring sight. Shouts echo as they vanish out the back exit.
- Team Rocket gets Ekans and Koffing but leaves behind Sandshrew.
- Oak’s emergency device buzzes faintly beneath the desk…

**Professor Oaks Audio Message:**

_“—to anyone who can hear this… This is Professor Oak. The lab has been compromised. They—took the specimens, the data.._
_(static, then a sharp beep)_
_“I’m being held… it’s underground—beneath the—”_
_(crackling)_
_“—don’t trust—\[static]—not what they seem. If they find the \[unintelligible] protocol, it’s over.”_
_“…Five of you. If you’re hearing this… you’re the last ones I can count on.”_
_(long pause, heavy breathing)_
_“Storage depot in pallet ... old ranger station on Route 1. There’s still time…”_
_(BZZT—signal cuts out)_

## WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED
This went exactly as planned

# Act 2

## Pallet Town

### **🔴 Top-Left House (Red Roof)**

#### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

Sawyer knocked and talked to Mina. Mina mentioned that her grandson went out looking in the forest and hadn’t returned. Let’s make him part of the rival group that they meet at the ranger house.

**Resident:** Retired Trainer “Mina”\
**Interior:** Cozy living space with medals, maps, and a display of old Poké Balls\
**Interaction:**

- **Mina is suspicious** at first, thinking the PCs might be connected to the chaos.

- After persuasion (CHA check or Pokémon interaction), she offers:
  - A minor healing item (Potion or Old Revival Herb)
  - Lore about strange Pokémon movements recently near Route 1 and Viridian

- **Optional Quest Hook:** She mentions her grandson (**Tommy**) went out looking for a "strange light" in the forest and hasn’t returned.

### **🔵 Top-Right House (Blue Roof)**

#### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

Gin knocked and talked to Mr. Dunford. Mr. Dunford said he saw the whole thing and saw Professor Oak get taken away. He didn’t give Gin any items.

**Resident:** “Mr. Dunford,” a conspiracy-minded ex-Pokéball engineer\
**Interior:** Tools, notes, cracked Pokéballs, and mechanical parts\
**Interaction:**

- Offers to inspect the players’ Pokéballs.

- **INT (Tech) check** can yield:
  - An upgrade to increase a Pokéball’s capture success by +1 (once)
  - Or a prototype “Sleep Ball” (functions like a Great Ball with +1 if the target is asleep)

- **Rumors:** Claims the attack was “coordinated using hacked Pokéballs” and warns of “hijack signals” in the area.

### **🟢 Middle-Left Building (Green Roof) – Storage Depot**

_The door is locked._ DC 13 str check or sleight of hand to open. _Inside, you see crates, some rummaged through, some damaged, some unopened._ If the players make perception checks see if they notice or hear the rattata in here. They may hear a soft **shuffling noise** coming from behind a stack of broken crates. If they approach carefully, they'll find a small **Rattata**, its fur matted and one leg slightly limping, nestled among spilled packing straw and torn burlap.

**Exterior:** Locked fence and shipping crates\
**Interior:** Crates, boxes, some damaged\
**Interaction:**

- Requires STR check or Thieves’ Tools to get in
- Inside are useful supplies:
  - Pokéball x1d4, Potion x1d4, Antidote, Revive, Rare Candy (1)
  - A smashed Team Rocket communicator that could be reassembled (INT check)
- A lone **Rattata** sits in here:
🧪 Rattata Mechanics
- If a PC approaches calmly and offers food or uses **Animal Handling**, the Rattata may let them treat its minor wound (heals with a Potion or Medicine check DC 10).
- If treated kindly, it may decide to **bond with a PC**, especially one who has shown empathy toward Pokémon or is tied to the research program.
- Alternatively, it can be left in the care of the Pokémon Center substitute, where Kira will nurse it back to health.
- With a DC 13 perception check, they notice this Rattata is marked with a faint branding on its paw: **"TR-W12"** — a small but telling clue that Team Rocket isn’t just stealing Pokémon… they’re _experimenting_ on them.

#### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

Gin went inside and attacked the Rattata. It ran away and Mike comforted it and it went into his pokeball. They noticed the marking on the Rattata paw.

### **🟡 Bottom-Left Building (Yellow Roof) – Research Volunteer Housing**

**Resident:** Vacant but was housing out-of-town researchers\
&#x20;**Interior:** Bunk beds, notes, backpacks\
&#x20;**Interaction:**

- PCs can find logs from other research volunteers:
  - One mentions strange noise from the lab the night before
  - Another left a bag containing a field kit (includes Potion, Pokédex entry book, flashlight, and PokéSnack)

#### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

Gin went inside and attacked the Rattata. It ran away and Mike comforted it and it went into his pokeball. They noticed the marking on the Rattata paw. The group went inside and stole the things from the backpacks.

## Route 1

### 🐛 Caterpie Encounter: “The Shy Climber”

**REMEMBER TO HAVE PC ROLL 1d100 FOR SHINY**

_As you make your way through a quieter stretch of Route 1, the trees begin to thin, revealing a single low-hanging branch draped over the path._
If the players succeed on a **DC 12 Perception**, they notice something subtle:
**_A faint motion—barely visible._** _A small green shape clings to the underside of the branch. At first glance, it’s just another leaf. But then, it shifts—slowly, cautiously._ 
If the player gets closer they notice that - _Its body quivers—not with aggression, but fear._
**If a player sends out a Pokémon**, it immediately freezes, then **drops from the branch and tries to flee** into the underbrush.
- This triggers a **Dexterity saving throw** (DC 13) for the PC to react fast enough to stop it from escaping.
**However**, if a **player approaches alone, without a Pokémon**, it watches them closely. They must:
- Roll a **DC 12 Animal Handling or Pokémon Handling** check to calm it.
- Using an item like a PokéSnack, berry, or soft words grants **advantage**.
- On success, the Caterpie inches forward—timidly bumping its head into the PC. It’s offering trust.

If the PC places a Poké Ball down, it **willingly enters with a loyalty score of 1 automatically**.

#### Reality

Sawyer attacks without trying to comfort it. It falls out of the tree and runs away before Sawyer can catch it, almost killing it in the process.

### 🕊️ Pidgey Encounter: “The Watcher in the Trees”

As the party moves deeper into the thicket, the wind rustles high in the trees. The trees here grow close together, and visibility through them is low.
If the players look into the trees, call for a **DC 12 Perception or Survival check**. On success:
_A blur of feathers flashes between branches._ **_Something is following you. Watching._**
Suddenly, a high-pitched cry cuts through the woods—**“KREEEHH!”**
_A_ **_Pidgey dives from the trees_**_, eyes narrowed with fury. It darts toward the group, aiming a_ **_Quick Attack_** _at the first Pokémon it sees._
Ask the PCs to decide who they want to step forward to battle the Pidgey.
As the Pidgey screeches and circles back, a perceptive PC (**DC 13 Insight**) might recognize:
- This Pidgey has bruises and a damaged wing similar to that of the one from the lab they helped.
- The PC may try calling out, using **Pokémon Handling**, or referencing the other Pidgey it lost.
- If anyone says something like _“We’re trying to stop them”_ or references Team Rocket, the Pidgey hesitates.
This Pidgey was one of the **research pair in Oak’s lab**. Its partner was stolen by Team Rocket during the raid. When the lab was attacked, this one escaped—and has been **patrolling Route 1 ever since**, watching for danger.
It has seen Rocket scouts, hiding in the branches. It is _angry_, _grieving_, and _determined to protect the forest._
✅ Option 1: Fight and Subdue
- The Pidgey will fight until it reaches **25% HP**, then retreat to the trees, panting.
✅ Option 2: Calm Mid-Battle
- A PC may use **Pokémon Handling (DC 13)** or a memory from the lab to stop the battle.
- Mentioning “the other Pidgey” or Oak’s lab may trigger a recognition moment.
✅ Option 3: Catch It (Hard Mode)
- Can only be caught if the players **earn its trust** first (see above).
- If caught, it becomes a **fiercely loyal companion**—but has a personal vendetta against Team Rocket.

#### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

The Pidgey attacks. Bull fought it with his Abra and caught it.

### 🐛 Weedle Encounter: “The Fall and the Stinger”

_Early autumn leaves drift lazily to the ground. The wind rustles the upper branches, and somewhere above, a branch creaks with strain. A sharp snap echoes from the canopy. Then—_**_thump._**
_A small body crashes to the path in front of you, tumbling in a swirl of red and gold leaves. It lands curled, shuddering, and doesn’t move at first._
It’s a **Weedle**, and one of its tiny legs is caught awkwardly beneath it. The tip of its stinger twitches in pain—but it doesn’t lash out. Not yet.
🧠 Encounter Background
This Weedle **was chased out of its nest** by a scouting Team Rocket grunt earlier in the day. It tried to return after the invaders left, but the branch it used to climb home snapped under its weight.
It’s injured, frightened, and doesn’t know if the PCs are enemies or another threat.
- The Weedle lies still unless approached.
- A **DC 11 Pokémon Handling or Insight** check reveals that it’s more scared than hostile.
- If a **Pokémon is sent toward it**, it **immediately raises its stinger** and uses **Poison Sting** reactively.
- If **a trainer approaches alone** and speaks calmly or offers aid:
  - **Medicine DC 10** allows them to treat the Weedle.
  - Using a PokéSnack or Oran Berry grants **advantage** on bonding checks.
🧩 Options & Outcomes
- If handled with kindness, Weedle **doesn’t fight**—instead, it nudges the PC’s leg with its horn.
- If caught, this Weedle is fiercely loyal but cautious—it **won’t use Poison Sting unless ordered**, and prefers to _defend_ rather than _strike_.
- Alternatively, the PCs can **escort it to the base of a tree** where other Weedle tracks lead, and it may rejoin its swarm, turning back once to chirp a soft thank you.

#### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

The group attacks Weedle. After defeating it, Sawyer gave the Weedle a potion because he felt bad.

### ☠️ Team Rocket Flyover Encounter: “Eyes in the Sky”

_A low hum breaks the forest silence—then grows louder. Through a gap in the trees, a black silhouette streaks across the sunset: a sleek, dark air-balloon with multiple hanging baskets and a crimson "R" painted on the balloon._
Have the players decide what to do here.. Do they hide? Stand in the open?
Each PC makes a **DEX (Stealth)** check. DC 12, or group average.
- **Success:** The ship passes overhead. The Rockets don't see them.
- **Failure (any PC):** A grunt points down at the PCs. _“There!”_
_The Rocket ship begins to_ **_circle_** _and a hatch opens on the underside of one of the baskets. The airship drops two Poké Balls. They pop open in mid-air, releasing pokemon._ (Level 3 Meowth and Grimer)
If the battle happens, team rocket recalls the pokemon once they faint.

#### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

Team Rocket spotted the players and dropped down pokemon that the group eventually defeated.

### 🐾 Nidoran Double Encounter: “The Last Line of Defense”

**Pokémon:** Nidoran♂ and Nidoran♀\
**Tone:** Protective loyalty, desperate courage, sibling bond\
**Placement:** Near the northern edge of Route 1, just before the Ranger Station

_Against the treeline, you come across a_ **_small den carved into the hillside_**_, half-covered by loose vines and dirt. The entrance is partially collapsed._
_A low growl echoes out from within._
See what the PCs want to do here.. Do they send Pokemon in to investigate? Do they themselves look?
If provoked:
A **Nidoran♂** emerges and plants himself between the players and the den, baring his teeth. His fur is matted and one ear is torn.
Behind him, a **Nidoran♀** remains half-hidden near the den, nudging it frantically with her snout. Something’s clearly trapped beneath the debris.
🧠 Backstory:
The den once belonged to a small wild Nidoran family. During Team Rocket’s raid, a tremor or explosion caused part of the hillside to collapse. Now, only these two remain—and they’re trying to **dig out a sibling or parent trapped beneath the rubble**.
They don’t want to fight—but they **will**, to defend their home and each other.
🎮 Behavior & Mechanics:
- **Nidoran♂** is the aggressor: stands between the players and the den, growling, using **Leer** and **Poison Sting** if anyone gets too close.
- **Nidoran♀** is more reactive: doesn’t attack unless the den is directly disturbed.
🧩 Skill Challenge:
To calm or help them, players must:
- **Animal Handling or Pokémon Handling (DC 13)** to lower Nidoran♂’s guard
- **STR or Athletics (DC 12)** to help unearth the collapsed den
- **Medicine or Nature (DC 11)** to check on the trapped Pokémon’s health
If they succeed in helping:
An egg is revealed. Both Nidoran turn, sniff it, then look at the PCs with wide eyes. The egg is broken, but the Nidoran do not realise this. 
💞 Bonding Outcome Options:
- If a player offers food, healing, or stands protectively with them, **one of the Nidoran may choose to follow** them.
- Let players choose who bonds with which—based on how they acted. If multiple players helped, make it a fun roleplay moment.
- If the players leave them in peace, the Nidoran pair **nod silently and vanish into the brush**—grateful, but wild at heart.

#### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

Gin and Jett attack nidoran. Gin weakens and catches male and Jett weakens and catches female. They see that the egg is damaged and bring both nidorans out of the eggs and bond with them to help them bury the broken egg. +1 loyalty

### Ranger Station – Route 1

**The PCs arrive at the Ranger Station** — _a single-story, weathered structure tucked into the trees. The door hangs slightly ajar, and as you approach, the muffled sound of voices can be heard inside…_
_As you enter, 5 figures stand inside. One of them — a tall boy, looks to be in his 20s, in a maroon jacket with wild, copper hair — turns sharply at your entrance. The others pause what they’re doing, hands instinctively resting on Poké Balls at their belts._
_“Who are you? This place looked abandoned… didn't expect company.” (He glances back at his group, then at the items on the table.)_
Give the players the chance to respond.
_“There’s five of you. Five of us. One-on-one battles. The winner of each match picks one item from the stash.”_

#### Rival Group Challenge:

**Billy’s group proposes a series of five 1v1 Pokémon battles.**Each player from your party faces one rival. For every victory, the player gets to choose **one item** from the Ranger Station stockpile.\
Losses don’t prevent story progress but may limit access to items.
If the players refuse? The rivals take their picks and leave, though the players can still scavenge leftovers (just fewer or less valuable items).

#### **Oak’s Emergency Cache**

_Lined up on a table in the room are 5 items:_

**1.** 🧭 **_Slim Bronze Device with Extendable Antenna_ (Itemfinder)**A weather-worn gadget with a narrow bronze body and a telescoping antenna. A cracked glass screen flickers faintly when touched, and a dial on its side clicks through several unlabeled positions. When moved close to the ground, it emits a soft hum… almost like it’s sensing something nearby.
Activation: 1 Action (10-minute duration, 1 use per short rest)
Effect: While active, this device highlights hidden or buried objects within a 30 ft radius.
Mechanics: Gain advantage on Investigation or Survival checks to detect hidden items (e.g. Poké Balls, Ranger caches, field tools, TMs)

**2.** ✨ **_Glass Locket with Swirling Glitter Inside_ (Shiny Charm)**_A small oval-shaped glass pendant. Inside, delicate flecks of iridescent shimmer swirl slowly, almost unnaturally. The locket feels warm to the touch and occasionally pulses faintly._
**_Shiny Charm (Passive Effect)_**
_While worn, the locket emits a faint energy signature that affects wild Pokémon encounters. When rolling a d100 during encounters: on a result of 95–100, the encountered Pokémon is a shiny. Has 3 slots for upgrades on the backside. Has possible charms that can be used to upgrade this device._

**3.** 📡 **_Folded Metal Scanner with Radar Dish and LED Screen_ (PokéRadar)**_A compact device with a hinged base. When opened, it reveals a rotating dish and a small LED display, currently blinking with static. Several buttons are marked with worn icons — a footprint, a paw, and one resembling a Poké Ball. It makes a quiet chirp every few seconds._
_PokéRadar – Targeted Search Scanner_
_Use: Once per short rest, the user may activate the PokéRadar to scan the surrounding area (30 ft radius)._
_Activation Check: Make a Survival check. Effect on Success: Reveals one specific wild Pokémon species nearby (DM’s choice or highest result from encounter table)._
_Grants advantage on Tracking or Encounter checks for that Pokémon type until found._
_If used in tall grass, caves, or near known Pokémon zones, the scanner chirps louder as the party approaches the target._ 
_Roll __Result_
_1–9 __Common Pokémon encounter_
_10–14 __Uncommon encounter_
_15–20 __Rare encounter – includes rare species, evolved forms, or story-linked Pokémon_

**4.** 🔧 **_Leather Roll of Tools and Metal Components_ (Poké Ball Repair Kit)**_Carefully bundled and sealed with a Ranger insignia strap, this roll contains a variety of fine tools — needle-nose pliers, calibration calipers, tiny screwdrivers — alongside Poké Ball shells and modular circuits._
_Poké Ball Repair & Crafting Toolset_
_When the player has this item: They may attempt to repair a broken or malfunctioning Poké Ball (including snagged balls or those damaged in the field). 1 per short rest. They may craft a basic Poké Ball during a long rest._
_Repair DCs: Minor Damage: DC 10 Investigation check. Full Rebuild or Custom Ball: DC 15+, requires multiple parts_
_Success: Restores the Poké Ball to working condition._

**_5. 🧺 Worn Ranger’s Satchel with Herbal Stitchwork_ (Satchel of Resourcefulness)**
_A rugged leather shoulder bag, its surface cracked and stained from years in the field. Dozens of stitched pouches line the inside, each containing crushed herbs, dried berries, and resinous powders. Tucked into the inner lining is a faded chart titled “Emergency Synthesis Protocols,” with mysterious numerical notations and arcane symbols around each item entry._
_Twice per long rest, the holder may roll 1d20 to synthesize a helpful item from the satchel. The item forms slowly inside one of the pouch compartments, wrapped in waxed linen or tucked into a glass vial._
_🔹 Twice per long rest, the holder may roll 1d20 to synthesize a helpful item from the satchel._

## Viridian City

### **🏥 Pokémon Center – Viridian City**

_The doors slide open, but unlike the usual warm hum of activity, the Viridian Pokémon Center feels still — too still. Only one trainer sits along the far wall. Nurse Bell glances up from the counter, her eyes tired, her Chansey already preparing the healing bays before you even ask._
_The bright lights seem a bit dimmer here — or maybe it’s just the weight of what’s happening._
🧍 NPCs Inside:
💠 Nurse Joy
- Wary but trying to maintain professionalism. She’s seen injured Pokémon acting strangely — possibly from exposure to neural sync tech.
- She received **Oak’s message**, but doesn’t know what to do. She _might_ ask if the players also got the message.
_“Welcome to the Viridian Pokémon Center. You look like you've had a rough time... Let’s get your team checked out right away. Chansey, prepare the scanner, please.”_
_(If asked about recent activity)\
&#x20;“Strange... a lot of Trainers have come through here talking about odd behavior in wild Pokémon. I’ve sent a few reports to the League, but no one’s responded yet.”_
💠 Jazz (Trainer)
- Young trainer, brown hair, tall. He lives in Viridian City, was challenged by a group of young trainers and they beat him pretty bad.
- _“Saw some cocky kids heading toward Route 2... said they were gonna ‘rescue the professor themselves.’ Told me to stay out of the way.”_

1. **Notice Board**:
   - "Lost Pokémon near Route 22, west of Viridian City"
   - "Trainer seeking battle partner for Pewter Gym prep"
   - "Suspicious Pokémon spotted near forest"

### 🏪 Viridian City Poké Mart

_The Mart is a small building with blue trim and wide windows. A faded “Poké Mart” sign hangs askew over the entrance, and one of the windows has a crack in the corner — recently repaired with tape. A delivery truck is parked outside, half-unloaded._
_The door jingles as you enter, but the usual cheery music is gone — replaced by the faint hum of a backup generator. Inside, the clerk stands behind a plexiglass divider, glancing nervously at a notepad. Shelves are stocked… but not full._
🧑‍💼 NPC: Clerk – _Jared_
- _20s, anxious but good-natured. Wears a Poké Mart vest over a hoodie._ He's been manning the store alone since the other employee quit after hearing about the trouble in Pallet.
- He's heard of Oak's disappearance, but only vague rumors — and he’s jumpy about it.
_“Hey, you’re... Oak’s kids, right? Or... volunteers?”_ 
_“Someone else came through asking about him yesterday. Didn’t buy anything, just... watched me for a bit. Gave me the creeps.”_
_“I’ve got a few things left. Delivery’s late, again. The whole supply chain’s a mess. Viridian Forest’s even worse — drivers won’t go near it.”_

🎯 Interaction Hooks

- **Clue about Rivals**: Jared might mention a group of five trainers who passed through earlier. One of them “flashed a League badge” that didn’t look real. Says that the rivals tried to buy out everything so that no one else could get any.
- **Back Room Access** (with Persuasion or Insight check):
  - Players can convince Jared to show them the storage room.\
    They find **notes about rising shoplifting**, **a broken PokéGear**, or even a **League-issued emergency flare** in a box marked “DO NOT USE.”


### 🏡 Caretaker’s House – "Ms. Juniper’s Home" (Bottom-Left yellow house with blue roof)

_A tidy cottage surrounded by a well-kept yard and sturdy wooden fencing. Flowering berry bushes grow along the side, and a small handmade sign hangs by the door:_ **_“Please do not disturb injured Pokémon. Thank you!”_**
_The house feels calm — like a pocket of stillness untouched by recent chaos. You hear faint humming from inside, and the scent of berries hangs in the air._
🧍 NPC: Ms. Laurel Juniper
(Not related to Professor Juniper — she just thinks the name sounds “scholarly.”)
- Elderly woman in her 60s, retired Pokémon nurse.
- Worked as a field technician for the Indigo League, treating wild and injured Pokémon on the outskirts of battle zones.
- Has no love for Team Rocket — claims they used to “test toxins” on Viridian wildlife years ago.
_“You’re Oak’s little ones, aren’t you? Brave hearts, coming here after what’s happened. Come in. I’ll make tea — and I’ll tell you what I saw.”_
🍵 Calm & Recovery (Short Rest Sanctuary)
- Players may **rest safely here**, fully recovering their own HP and regaining any minor resources (like 1 used Trainer Feature, or half-used item effects).
- Any Pokémon with minor injuries are tended to by Ms. Juniper and her **Bayleef** companion.
🔍 Lore or Plot Hook: Juniper’s Warning
_“I’ve worked with wild Pokémon for decades — I know what it looks like when they’re sick, scared, or territorial. But lately? They’re moving wrong. Acting without purpose. Some don’t respond to pain. Others attack their own kin. Something’s dulling their instincts — like they’re following a signal none of us can hear.”_
_“Last week, I treated a Sandshrew with no injuries — none I could see, anyway. But he wouldn't eat. Wouldn’t move right. Just stared at the wall. A few hours later, he started convulsing... then ran straight into the woods like something called him. I believe something is disrupting the instinctual patterns of wild Pokémon — especially near Route 2 and the edges of Viridian Forest.”_
🧪 Juniper’s Beliefs (Suspicion, not Proof)
- She suspects the existence of an **external, unnatural frequency or signal** interfering with Pokémon instincts — possibly psychic, electronic, or a blend.
- She once worked alongside a League researcher who studied brainwave alignment in Kadabra. That person died years ago... but their notes described similar symptoms in lab tests.
_“What if someone found a way to send out a call — not with sound, but with sync frequencies? What if it doesn’t need to control... just confuse?”_

### 🗂️ Middle Yellow Building - League Liaison Office – Viridian City Branch

_A well-maintained yellow building with a blue roof and a League emblem over the door. The blinds are closed, and a metal sign reading_ **_“Temporary Closure – Do Not Enter Without Authorization”_** _hangs slightly askew. There are no lights on inside._
_The door is locked but doesn’t seem broken. A faint green light pulses from inside near a computer monitor._
🧑‍💻 Purpose in the World
- This office once served as a **League checkpoint and record station**, logging trainer activity in Viridian and issuing permits for Forest entry.
- It has **League terminals**, a few secured lockers, and an access node that connects directly to the main Indigo Plateau server… though currently only in offline mode.
- Since Oak’s kidnapping, the Liaison Officer (a character you could introduce or say has vanished) left suddenly — possibly trying to report the sync breach.
🔓 Entry Options
- The door is **locked**, but a **DC 14 Thieves’ Tools or Tech Tools** check will open it.
- Or players might find a spare key behind a **League poster** outside with a high **Investigation check**.
Once inside, they find:
🖥️ Interior Layout (3 rooms)
1. **Front Room – Reception**
   - _You push open the door to the Liaison Office and step into a dim, still room. Dust floats in the filtered light slanting through shut blinds. A League crest hangs behind the counter, cracked slightly down the center. A worn reception desk stands near the entrance, cluttered with half-filled forms, a mug of cold coffee, and a long-dead comm terminal. Behind the desk, a filing cabinet leans at an awkward angle, as if someone pulled it open in a hurry and left it half-closed._
_A hand-scrawled note is taped to the wall:_**** _“⚠️ Viridian Forest Access Closed – Report to Pallet Outpost for clearance.”_ It’s signed by someone named “Lt. A. Lane.”
- Desk with old League pamphlets and trainer rulebooks.
- Filing cabinet with outdated Gym leader records and partial encounter logs (can hint at forest aggression patterns).
2. **Main Office – League Terminal**
   - _This room is colder. A single League-issue terminal blinks in sleep mode against the far wall. Folders are scattered across the floor — many trampled or torn, as if someone left in a rush or tried to erase something. One of the desk drawers hangs open, the lock broken. You can hear a faint high-pitched whine from the tower relay on the roof — barely audible inside, like a mosquito hum._
- On terminal: _LAST REMOTE ACCESS:_ `R-COMMANDER S.` _– Credential Level: REDACTED_
- Have the players make investigation checks. They see files were deleted, and that the last known sync signal was Site 14 - Viridian Forest.

### 🪵 Top-Left House – “The Quiet Lodger’s Home”
This building belongs to a **reclusive boarder named Ellis Hale**, a former **Pokémon field biologist** who now lives off-grid, researching independently. Ellis is secretive, hyper-aware, and _knows more than he's letting on_ about the neural interference affecting Pokémon.
This house works as a **tension-building location** — full of subtle unease and half-answers.
_Perched at the city’s northern edge, this cottage leans against the trees like it's trying to stay hidden. Its windows are covered with blackout curtains, and wind chimes made of bent Poké Balls clink gently in the breeze. A "No Visitors" sign is nailed crookedly to the door. The surrounding yard is overgrown, but not neglected — there’s precision in the chaos._
🧍 NPC: Ellis Hale
- _Mid-40s, wiry, wears patched field gea_r and always seems to be listening to something no one else hears.
- Former League biologist turned paranoid recluse. He quit after filing reports on Pokémon behavior that were “lost in bureaucracy.”
- Not hostile, but incredibly suspicious of everyone — including your players.
_“You’re not League? Not Rocket? Good. Then we can talk — but not for long. I’ve been watching their movement through the trees.”_
🧠 What’s Inside the House?
_The interior is dim, filled with research notes pinned to walls, hand-drawn maps, broken Poké Gear, and jars labeled with Pokémon fur, spores, and scales. A portable radio crackles softly in the background, looping faint static with occasional pings._
📌 Room 1 – Front Study / Paranoia Wall
_A chaotic display of maps and red-thread connections sprawls across the main room. Points on the Viridian forest are marked “silent zone,” “pattern burst,” and “known drone path.” A photo of Professor Oak is pinned with the word “Missing?” written over it in Sharpie._
- **Investigation DC 12**: Players find he’s tracking movement patterns of Pokémon leaving the forest.
- **Insight DC 15**: Realize Ellis is monitoring **signal pulses**, and that **he detected one 4 hours ago**, centered deeper in Viridian Forest — matching the "Site 14" info from the League Office.
📌 Room 2 – Back Room Lab
_A makeshift biology setup — centrifuges, slides, and a projection viewer showing zoomed-in Pokémon brain scans. One of them shows an overactive neural node pulsing in sync with a waveform display._
- **Pokémon Handling or Medicine DC 13**: Players deduce the waveform lines up _exactly_ with the time the sync tech was stolen from Oak’s lab.
- One cage in the corner is **smashed open**. A scratched nameplate reads:\
  &#x20;“Subject 9B – Sandshrew (Retained Defiance Traits)”\
  &#x20;This could tie into the earlier Sandshrew from the lab or Juniper’s house.
🪙 What Can Players Get Here?
- If players **earn Ellis’ trust**, he offers:
  - A **Sync Dampener Band - When worn by a Pokemon, it makes them much more resistant to the sync effects.** (worn on a Pokémon; gives it +2 on saves vs Charm/Domination-like effects).
If they **threaten or break in**, Ellis escapes through a hidden exit — but leaves behind logs confirming **Team Rocket drone drops** into the woods.

### **🏛️ Viridian Gym – Currently Inactive**
_You stand in front of the old Viridian Gym — once home to the final and most dangerous Gym Leader in Kanto. Now, it’s eerily quiet.  The building is large, square, and fortified-looking, with barred windows and dusty signage. The stone plaque reading “Viridian Gym” is cracked, and the doors are chained shut with a notice posted by the League._ 
**_“This facility is temporarily closed pending internal investigation. Do not enter without authorization.”_**
_There's a strange hum beneath the silence — like something dormant, waiting._
🧠 DM Notes:
- **Status:** Gym has been closed for over a year. Officially, it's under League audit. Unofficially, it was abandoned after the former Gym Leader (Giovanni) disappeared following a failed experiment involving neural sync devices and rare Pokémon.
- **Rumors:** Locals say strange lights flicker inside the building at night. Some even claim to hear Pokémon cries echoing through the gym walls.
🧩 Secrets & Potential Plot Hooks:
- 🔐 **Locked Interior:** If the players sneak in or return later with proper clearance, they are met with a large empty room, with stairs leading down. There is a black door with a keycard reader that is the only way to enter. This is found much later in the campaign.

### 🏫 Viridian City Pokémon School
_You see a cozy-looking school tucked near the fountain, but the usual laughter of children is absent.  Kids' drawings of Pikachu, Squirtle, and Charmander decorate the windows, but there's tension in the air — the school has been recently disrupted. A stern-looking woman in a lab coat is locking the gate behind her as a few students and teachers hurry away._
_“No classes today,” she snaps to a parent who approaches. “Not with what’s going on in the woods. Go home — and keep your Pokémon close.”_
_The school feels more like a bunker now than a place of learning._
🧠 DM Notes:
- **Current State:** School is closed due to recent Pokémon aggression near Route 2 and within Viridian Forest. Parents have pulled students from class, and the League has requested a temporary shutdown.
- **Head Instructor:** _Instructor Alma_, an experienced former Trainer who now teaches battle basics and Pokémon care. She’s suspicious of League and Rocket activities.
- **Recent Incident:** One student’s partner Pokémon (a Squirtly) turned hostile during a lesson — possibly due to external sync interference. It had to be tranquilized.
- **Pokémon on Campus:** Normally a few beginner-level Pokémon roam the fenced outdoor space (Rattata, Hoppip, Pichu), but they've been relocated temporarily.
1\. Main Classroom
**Visual Description (DM):**_A large open room with wide windows (shuttered for now), wooden desks arranged in a semi-circle, and colorful chalk illustrations of Pokémon types and matchups on the blackboard. Shelves along the side hold training Poké Balls, battle mats, and plush models of Pokémon. One wall is a timeline of League Champions._
**Read-Aloud (as players enter):**
_The moment you step inside, the scent of chalk and dry ink fills your nose. The classroom is tidy, but the energy is strange — like a lesson ended too abruptly._
_On the chalkboard, a battle chart is halfway erased, still showing:\
&#x20;“Electric > Flying – but what about Ground?”_
_A faint humming sound comes from a ceiling light above. A few desks are scuffed, and one has small claw marks dug into the edge. There are 2 rooms branching off of this one to either side._
2\. Library Nook
**Visual Description (DM):** A cozy corner with low bookshelves, a reading rug covered in PokéDoll toys, and a holo-display monitor currently turned off. Books are categorized by topic: "Pokémon Behavior," "Trainer Ethics," "Regional Maps," and a few copies of _"The League Code — Illustrated Edition."_
**Read-Aloud:**
_A cozy corner with low bookshelves, a reading rug covered in PokéDoll toys, and a holo-display monitor currently turned off. The library nook is quiet — too quiet. Several books are missing, and one shelf leans as if someone bumped into it hard. On the desk nearby, an open report shows an aerial map of Viridian Forest with red marks at several “disturbed nest sites.”_\
&#x20;_A sticky note reads:_\
&#x20;_“—see if this matches Oak’s findings. We can’t ignore the sleep effect anymore.”_
**Arcana/Pokémon Lore DC 13:** Identify that the notes reference _Sleep Powder dispersion ranges_ — likely linked to modified Grass-types, like the Vileplume used in the lab raid.

3\. Instructor Alma’s Office

**Visual Description (DM):**A small, paper-filled space with a League-certified diploma on the wall and a photo of Alma as a young trainer.. The desk is piled with notes, and a half-covered sheet diagramming a broken headpiece device sits under a folded map.

**Alma’s Dialogue (when players enter):**

**Alma (stern but calm):** _“I thought I told the League we’re closed… oh. You’re not with them, are you?”_

_(She narrows her eyes at the Pokémon with the players — studying how they move.)_

_“If you brought them here for shelter, I can offer that. But if you’re poking around for more than answers… be careful where you look.”_

If the players ask what the earpiece is:

_(She gestures to the damaged earpiece on the desk.)_

_“This? Found it tangled in a bush behind the playground. One of my students saw someone in black running into the woods. Didn't recognize the uniform — but it sure wasn’t League.”_

🔍 Items & Secrets in the Office:

- **Damaged Sync Device (partial earpiece):**

  - **Tech Use/Pokémon Lore DC 15:** Confirms it’s the same kind of tech described in Oak’s research — early neural link prototype.

🧩 Alma’s Role in the Story:

Alma isn’t aligned with Team Rocket or the League. She’s loyal to Oak and protective of her students. She’ll share:

- Warnings about Pokémon acting strangely during school activities.

- Her belief that _"someone is testing sync tech in the field — on wild Pokémon, without consent.._

- Her suspicions that the League is covering something up.

**Info to give players:**If the players earn her trust, she gives them a field note:

_“Unconfirmed but repeated sightings of a strange Butterfree near the eastern forest — its spores linger longer and may cause hallucinations. Might be linked to the sync tests.”_


### 🏚️ Bottom-Right House - The Hermit's Lodge

_The path ends at a crooked little house nestled against the tree line — almost like the forest is trying to reclaim it. The garden out front is wild, and the roof bears moss as if no one's maintained it in years. A small, weathered cottage with a creaky wooden porch and wind chimes made from old Poké Balls._
_As you approach, the wind stirs the strange Poké Ball chimes overhead. You see movement through a window — someone is inside._
_A handmade sign near the door reads:_ **_"Knock only if you must."_**
🧠 DM Notes:
- This house belongs to **Cedar**, a reclusive former psychic-type specialist and ex-researcher who fled League work years ago. They’ve been tracking neural sync technology independently, suspecting it would one day be abused — and now it has.
- They are a **valuable but paranoid NPC** who can offer insights the League and even Oak don’t yet have.
_(The door creaks open before you even touch it — revealing a darkened room lit only by the bluish glow of a crystal suspended in the rafters.)_
A voice rasps from inside:
**_“You brought it with you… haven’t you? The signal. I can feel it pulsing off your Pokémon like heat.”_**
_(A figure steps into view — wiry, hunched, wrapped in a faded researcher’s coat and layers of scarves. One of his eyes glows faintly blue — mechanical, scanning you even as his real eye doesn’t blink.)_
_“I don’t get visitors. Not real ones. Just agents, liars, and shadows. But you…” (he eyes one of the Pokémon)\
&#x20;“…you’re touched. One of yours has seen the inside of it — hasn’t it? The network. The sync.”_
_(He lets out a humorless chuckle.)\
&#x20;“Or maybe not. Maybe it’s just another test. Are you going to ask about the forest? The lab? Oak?”_
_(He leans close, unnervingly.)\
&#x20;“He told you to come here, didn’t he? Or was it one of them?”_
🧓 Cedar the Hermit
- Age: 50s
- Appearance: Grey robe, wild hair, one cybernetic eye (scanning tech from an abandoned sync rig)
- Personality: Grumpy, cryptic, and sharp-witted — thinks in riddles, doesn’t trust anyone at first
- Pokémon Partner: **Hypno**, always silently observing from behind them
- Background: Used to work with Oak and Blaine during the very first tests of neural sync. Quit after a sync test with a Drowzee caused uncontrolled hallucinations.
🐭 If They Show the Rattata:
_(Cedar stiffens as soon as he sees Rattata. His cybernetic eye pulses once, then twice.)_
**__** _“...Don’t let it near the walls.”\
&#x20;(He steps back, uneasy.)\
&#x20;“That one’s still inside.”_
_(He squints at its paw. Slowly walks forward and kneels beside it, tilting its leg gently to expose the faded Rocket tag.)_
**__** _“Marking pattern... Subject Thirty-Two, maybe Thirty-Four. Early-stage imprinting. They weren’t syncing behavior — they were syncing instincts. Hunger, aggression, territorial drive.”\
&#x20;(Beat.)\
&#x20;“They weren’t trying to make it stronger… they were trying to see if they could_ **_rewrite what it feared._**_”_
_ “Tell me... has it acted strangely? Attacked without provocation? Spooked at nothing? Does it dream with its eyes open?”_
_(He places a hand just above the Rattata’s head, not touching.)\
&#x20;“I can still feel the tether. It’s like... part of it never left the test room. You didn’t catch this one... you rescued it.”_
**If a player confirms strange behavior or expresses concern:**
**_Cedar (nods solemnly):_** _“It may still be carrying a low-band signal echo. Not dangerous to you — but if they’re still tracking frequencies, it could lead them to you.”_
_(He rummages through a drawer and hands the player a small metallic sticker.)\
&#x20;“Sync scrubber. Primitive, but it’ll block outbound pulses. Stick it under the fur on its back. Won’t hurt.”_
🧠 If Players Ask What Happens If They Don’t Scrub It:
**_Cedar (flatly):_** _“Best case? It becomes anxious, erratic. Trust issues.\
&#x20;Worst case?” (He stares at the Rattata for a long time.)\
&#x20;“It stops thinking it's yours.”_
🔐 If They Ask About Oak:
**__**_“He’s a good man. Too good. Trusted the League. Trusted them. Thought he could fix it. They took his data, and now they’re running live field syncs without safety protocols._
_“But that wasn’t the plan. The tech was meant to bond — to link trainer and Pokémon on a deeper level. Empathy. Instead, they’re rewriting instincts. Taking control.”_
Ending
_“This isn’t just about Oak. It’s bigger. Older. There are whispers of an artifact that predates the League — something they’re trying to reverse-engineer. Neural control was just the first step.”_
_(He draws a symbol in chalk — a stylized eye with tendrils spreading from it like roots.)_
_“Find this symbol again, and you’ll know you’re close to the next node. But be ready — the Pokémon aren’t the only ones being reprogrammed anymore.”_
_Also, check the route to the west, I have heard that things aren’t as they usually are._

## Route 2

_As you leave the edge of Viridian City behind, the world shifts. The paved roads give way to packed dirt, and the trees stretch higher here. The tall grass is still, but not silent and there’s a hush in the air._

### Pokemon Table: Level 3
Common: Pidgey, Caterpie, Weedle, Krabby
Uncommon: Oddish, Paras, Psyduck, Slowpoke, Horsea
Rare: Jigglypuff, Doduo, Staryu
Super Rare: Clefiairy, Dratini

## Route 22

_As you step off the western edge of Viridian City, the dirt path beneath your feet shifts — becoming narrower, less traveled. Wildflowers bloom unchecked along the roadside, and tall grass creeps toward the worn edges of the trail._
_But something is… off._
_The air is still. Too still. No buzzing of Beedrill. No rustling in the bushes. Not even the distant cry of a Pidgey. Just wind and water — the faint gurgle of a slow-moving pond up ahead._
_A thin mist rolls off the water’s edge. The sunlight filtering through the trees feels muted, like something unseen is dimming the world just slightly._
_Then you notice:\
&#x20;A berry bush untouched. Grass that looks trampled, then abandoned. A nest half-built and left behind._
_Whatever normally lives here… it’s not here now\._

### 🌊 Echo Anomaly Site – Route 22

As the players move near the central pond:
_The air grows strangely still, and the sounds of the nature around you grow distant. Even the buzzing of insects fades away near the water. A faint ripple moves across the pond — even though there’s no wind._
A DC 12 **Perception (Wisdom)** or **Insight (Wisdom)** check reveals:
- The water is _vibrating_ in a rhythmic pulse — like a subsonic beat.
- Players feel _a subtle tingling at the back of their neck_ as they approach.
🕳️ Discovery – The Submerged Device
Players who investigate the pond (wading, diving, or using tools) can find a **small metal object** buried in the silt:
_About a foot below the surface, your hand brushes against something smooth and warm — a metallic plate. It's part of a flat, disc-shaped object, roughly the size of a Poké Ball lid. It's humming softly…_
**Investigating it** (DC 13 Arcana, Nature, or Technology check):
_It seems to be a metal disc with a red light on top and a dial on the bottom. It looks similar to some of the equipment you saw in Professor Oak’s Lab, except this looks to maybe be an older model._
- It is a **Neural Sync Prototype**, similar in construction to the components in Oak’s lab.
- The device is **damaged but not completely dead** — it’s outputting a faint pulse on an old frequency band.
Optional Failure Consequence:
- On a failed check by 5+, the character experiences a psychic feedback loop:\
  &#x20;_Your vision splits momentarily. You see wild Pokémon—Mankey, Poliwag—collapsing in sync. Then, nothing._
**If the players turn the dial off:**
_The moment the signal dies, you feel it — not with your ears, but in your chest. The strange pressure lifts, like the whole route exhales for the first time in days._
_A breeze stirs the tall grass. Birds cry out from the treetops. In the distance, you hear the buzz of wings and the rustle of underbrush._
_The pond, once eerily silent, now glimmers with ripples. Wildflowers sway gently again. Something scampers through the grass and doesn't immediately flee._
_It’s subtle, but unmistakable:_ **_life is returning_** _to this area._
_Whatever that device was, it wasn’t just disrupting Pokémon — it was suffocating the entire ecosystem. And now, you’ve freed it._

#### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
Players were able to find and disable the device here

### **🏛️ Far-left Building:**

_A tall stone archway rises from the cliffs ahead, flanked by iron gates and a Ranger outpost. The building is older than the rest of Route 22 — built with clean lines and League stonework. Above the doors, the worn emblem of the Indigo Plateau glints faintly in the sun._
_A large paper notice is pinned to the locked double doors of the League checkpoint building, fluttering slightly in the breeze. The text is printed in bold, but smudged with rain and dust:_
🛑 NOTICE – INDIGO PLATEAU ACCESS SUSPENDED 🛑
**_Effective Immediately – By Order of the Kanto Pokémon League Security Council_**_All trainer access to_ **_Route 23_** _and the_ **_Indigo Plateau_** _has been temporarily suspended._
_Due to the ongoing investigation into the_ **_Pallet Town Laboratory Incident_**_, all checkpoint operations are closed until further notice._

### **_🔥 Encounter Title: “Ash and Embers” (If players disable the device)_**

_As you continue down the path, the air is crisper than before. Life has started to return — birds call from the trees, and the rustle of grass no longer feels empty._
_But then, something unusual catches your eye:\
&#x20;A patch of scorched earth nestled among delicate wildflowers.\
&#x20;The blackened grass still smolders faintly. At its edge, two distinct sets of hoofprints — small and cloven — are singed into the soil, trailing off into the reeds at the base of a rocky ledge._
_If a player investigates, continue:_
_You push aside the reeds — and there they are._
_Two Ponyta._
_One is smaller, its flames low and flickering like candlelight. Its legs are scraped, and it leans against the other for support. The second — taller and stronger — stands protectively in front, its flaming mane glowing a deep amber. Both creatures look worn, but not wild. Their coats are soot-streaked, their eyes wary, but not unkind._
_The larger Ponyta lowers its head slightly, not in challenge… but caution._
_They don’t bolt — not yet._
_As you make your move, a breeze passes through the clearing — lifting ash into the air like fireflies. The younger Ponyta lets out a soft whinny, and the elder gives a quiet nudge, as if encouraging it to be brave._
_🎁 Optional Unique Traits_
_🔥_ **_Scorchstep_** _Once per day, either Ponyta can leave behind a trail of embered hoofprints. Any creature that moves through them takes 1 fire damage per step (flavorful battlefield control)._
_🔥_ **_Coaled Bond_** _(Passive Ability)\
&#x20;If one Ponyta falls below half HP, the other gains temporary hit points equal to its level and can take the_ **_Help_** _action as a bonus action on its next turn. Once per long rest._

#### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
Gin and Mike battle the Ponyta, Mike catches his first and then uses roar on Gin's to try to make the Ponyta run away. This is the beginning of the interparty conflict between Mike and others. Gin does eventually catch the Ponyta.

## Viridian Forest

### 🛑 Forest Lockdown: “Containment Protocol 17”

#### IF THE PLAYERS HAVE NOT FOUND AND DISABLED THE DEVICE FROM ROUTE 22:

As the party approaches the north gate leading into Viridian Forest (e.g. via Route 2 or the western road), they see:
- _The gatehouse is_ **_barricaded_** _with metal shutters and caution tape._
- _Two_ **_League Rangers_** _stand guard, along with a_ **_stationary PokéDrone_** _overhead that flickers with an alert status light._
- _A sign posted on the gate reads:_
**_WARNING: Zone Offline — Neural Containment Active_** _“Access to Viridian Forest restricted pending sync field suppression.\
&#x20;Entry without a dampening signature is prohibited.”_
**Ranger Thorne:** _“Sorry, trainers. Forest’s off-limits. You hear that hum in the air? That’s not nature — that’s interference. Something’s throwing off every Poké Ball scanner and tracker for miles. We’ve already lost a few Pokémon deeper in. Won’t risk more.”_
If pressed for info:
_“The League suspects a signal node or some device is present near Route 22. Until we confirm it's disabled, nobody gets in or out of the forest. Not unless you want to end up like those missing Beedrill scouts.”_
If asked about pallet incident:
_“The Pallet incident? Yeah, this is part of it. That tower tech’s leaking interference into the surrounding routes. Disabling it from Route 22 should sever the loop.”_

#### IF THE PLAYERS HAVE FOUND AND DISABLED THE DEVICE FROM ROUTE 22:

🎙️ Ranger Dialogue at the Viridian Forest Gate
**Scene Setup:** _The forest gate no longer buzzes with red alarms, and the barricades have been partially lifted — but not fully removed. One of the Rangers steps forward as the players approach. He adjusts his hat, squinting into the woods, then turns toward the group._
**Ranger Thorne (grim but respectful):** _“You’re the ones who took out the signal node on Route 22, right? We saw the interference readings drop across the board. Whatever you did… it helped. Things are calming down — a few wild Pokémon even returned to the treeline this morning.”_
_He pauses, frowning slightly.\
&#x20;“But there’s still something very wrong. The sync distortion’s not gone — just weaker. We ran a diagnostic sweep right after the pulse died down, and guess what?”_
_He taps the side of a small radar unit on his belt.\
&#x20;“Residual frequencies are still coming from deeper inside the forest. Something in there is amplifying the signal. Maybe a second device. Maybe worse.”_
_He glances toward the trees — quiet, still, unnaturally so.\
&#x20;“We haven’t sent anyone in yet. Not without backup. Pokémon are still vanishing. Others… come out changed.”_
_Then, a softer tone:\
&#x20;“If you’re headed in… watch for red lights in the canopy. And don’t trust anything that walks out of the mist without blinking.”_
### 🗼 The Signal Towers

#### Tower 1

_As the players approach the clearing, the underbrush thins out, revealing a narrow trail of trampled grass leading to a squat, metallic structure jutting from the forest floor. It hums faintly with a low, mechanical whine—barely perceptible, like a mosquito just at the edge of hearing. The tower stands maybe 30 feet tall, skeletal in design, a red light pulsing slowly at its tip. Panels along its base blink erratically, and the air around it seems... off. Static crackles faintly in their Pokédexes._
_A puffball of fur emerges from the brush, but its twitching antennae and glitching gaze betray its condition. Red targeting lines flicker in its bugged-out eyes. It chitters softly, then charges forward erratically._
Also, from the shadows behind the tower, a faint rustling draws your attention. A green shape slinks forward—sluggish, almost hesitant. It’s a Caterpie. But something is wrong. Its antennae twitch erratically, glowing faintly red at the tips. Segments along its back shimmer with embedded nodes. As it lifts its head, its black eyes flicker, tracing you like a targeting system. Then, without warning, it lets out a shrill static chirp and lunges forward — far faster than a Caterpie should move.\
**If the tower is disabled during the battle:**_Venonat and Caterpie freeze mid-movement. The glow in the Venonat’s eyes dims, and its antennae twitch erratically. Caterpie’s whole body seizes up. It curls slightly, emitting a shrill whimper, but stays upright._ They take no action on their next turn. At the start of each following turn, they must roll a DC 10 Wisdom Save:
- **Success: It collapses, dazed. It becomes vulnerable, allowing capture, comfort, or examination.**
- **Failure: It lashes out blindly — Confused for one round, then rolls again next turn.**

##### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
Players defeat the pokemon and disable the tower.

#### Tower 2

_The trees part once again — not into a clearing this time, but into what looks like a scar in the forest. The grass here is patchy, clawed up in places. Jagged hunks of rusted metal and broken fencing are strewn about as if some old outpost once stood here, long since scavenged. In the center, perched atop a heap of twisted rebar, looms another signal tower — nearly identical to the first. This one crackles audibly, its red beacon pulsing erratically, as if out of sync._
_The moment the players draw near, a_ **_sharp metallic clanging_** _echoes across the ruins._
_From behind a stack of broken crates, a_ **_Mankey_** _vaults into view — but not as they know it. One of its eyes flickers with a glowing red light, and its fists twitch with constant, involuntary motion. It snarls — but the sound cuts in and out like a corrupted audio file. Then it screeches, lunging forward with unrelenting aggression._
_Almost simultaneously, there’s movement near the base of the tower. What you thought was a pile of broken earth begins to rise — slowly, shakily. A_ **_Sandshrew_**_. But not just any Sandshrew. There’s a moment of recognition — the faint scar above its right eye, the uneven patch of fur from a recent bandage on its paw… this is_ **_the same Sandshrew_** _your group helped heal back in Professor Oak’s lab._
_Only now… it’s different._
_Its hide, once dry and matte, is now slick with a strange oily shimmer and a glitched red ring flickers behind its eyes. When it sees you, it hesitates — just for a breath. Then its body jerks, spasms… and it charges, claws sparking as if forced into motion._
_They both attack in tandem — the Mankey leaping erratically across the field, while the Sandshrew tries to flank and pin._
**If the tower is disabled during the battle:**
_Mankey stumbles mid-charge, landing face-first with a surprised grunt. It rises slowly, fists trembling, then pauses — as if unsure where it is. Sandshrew lets out a low, static-laced hiss and curls protectively, its body still twitching._
_Both Pokémon take_ **_no action on their next turn._** _Then, at the start of each following turn, they must roll a_ **_DC 10 Wisdom Save_**_:_
- **_Success:_** _The Pokémon collapses or flees, dazed and vulnerable to capture or calming._
- **_Failure:_** _It lashes out unpredictably —_ **_Confused for one round_**_, then rolls again next turn._

##### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
Players defeat the pokemon and disable the tower.

#### Tower 3

_The forest darkens here — unnaturally so. The canopy overhead twists densely together, choking out much of the sunlight. Vines hang low, heavy with wilted leaves, and the ground underfoot feels soft. A metallic scent hangs in the air, mixed with the pungent aroma of rotting vegetation._
_Up ahead, at the center of a sunken grove, another tower rises. Its red beacon pulses like a heartbeat, casting an eerie glow across the twisted underbrush. The hum of interference here is thicker, like standing inside a buzzing hive._
_From the tangle of vines at the tower’s base, a figure lurches into view. It’s an_ **_Oddish_**_. Its leaves are charred and patchy, the scars of its earlier injury still fresh. The group recognizes it — the very same Oddish they stabilized at Professor Oak’s lab after the fire. But now, its eyes are vacant… hollow. Glowing red lines trace down from its stems like corrupted veins, and as it moves, small spores drift off its body — dark, unnatural, crackling faintly with static._
_It lets out a shrill, static-ridden cry — one that rises in pitch like a signal searching for a frequency. And then it attacks._
_A moment later, the brush behind it parts with a thud._
_A_ **_Cubone_** _steps forward, dragging its club behind it like a dead weight. But something is off. The bone in its paw pulses faintly with a neon-blue crackle, and its movements are unnervingly smooth. It doesn't scream. It doesn’t growl. It just locks eyes with the party… and sprints forward._

##### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
Players defeat the pokemon and disable the tower.

#### Main Tower

_The path here is unnatural. Trees bend away from the trail as if recoiling. The air is thick with interference — the Pokédexes don’t just crackle; they scream in brief digital tones, their screens flickering wildly. Your skin tingles. The hum of the signal is louder here. Angry. A distortion in the air ripples ahead like heat rising off pavement._
_Then you see it._
A massive tower pierces the clearing like a blade plunged into the earth. Nearly twice the height of the others, it’s covered in pulsing red nodes and twitching antennae that move _on their own_, like feelers scanning for prey. At its base, glowing conduits pulse in rhythm with your heartbeats.
And standing before it, perfectly spaced like a barrier… are five Pokémon.
They don’t growl. They don’t move. They just stare.
**Pikachu. Charmander. Bulbasaur. Squirtle. Eevee.**
- **_Pikachu_** _— Sparks dance across its fur erratically, arcing to the ground with each twitch. One eye is mechanical, blinking red in rhythm with the tower. Its cheeks pulse with stored voltage — overloaded._
- **_Eevee_** _— Its fur is pristine, eerily so. Smooth, artificial. There’s no emotion in its face — just glassy, flickering eyes. Its movements, unnaturally clean._
- **_Charmander_** _— Its tail flame flickers — but not like a normal fire. It pulses irregularly, like it’s tied to a heartbeat that isn’t its own. The tail burns dimly, casting more smoke than light, and every few seconds, it flares up in a burst of blue-green flame before sputtering again. And then something clicks — deep in its head — and its body moves without hesitation, claws igniting as it rushes forward, not with purpose, but like it's trying to outrun the pain. Like it doesn’t want to fight — but has no choice._       
- **_Bulbasaur_** _— Its bulb on its back pulses faintly, not with life, but like it’s holding something in. The vines that twitch from its sides look withered but twitch sporadically — like they're reacting to a signal no one else can hear. Then the vines lash forward, and its body jolts as if caught in a spasm._
- **_Squirtle_** _— Its shell is scuffed and discolored, the once-glossy surface now dulled with grime and soot. Thin trails of water leak from the corners of its shell, not in jets, but in slow, irregular drips — like it's leaking instead of attacking. When it sees the group, it doesn’t growl. It flinches. And then, it charges. Its movements are defensive, jittery — like it’s scared and lashing out._

##### 🔧 Main Tower Interaction

To Disable, 4 players need to press the buttons on the consoles at the same time, if they push one without the other, it will show a green light for 3 seconds and then fade out.
**_Once disabled_**_, all five Pokémon seize up at once. Their bodies flicker like disrupted holograms. They collapse — not unconscious, but… still. Free._

##### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
After several hints, the players finally disabled the tower and were able to catch the pokemon.

##### Prof. Oak Message:

Sawyer’s backpack starts beeping, it is Prof. Oak’s transponder blinking red again.
_“You did it… something changed... Team Rocket’s scrambling—they’re furious. Something you have disabled must have been one of their key amplifiers.”_
(You hear muffled shouting in the background, something slamming shut.)
_“Listen closely—this isn’t over. The interference isn’t gone, it’s just weaker. My captors… they’re agitated, moving me more frequently. I overheard them mention ‘the Pewter site.’ If they’re expanding there, it means they’re after something big. You must find out what that is.”_
(A loud bang echoes, and Oak’s voice quickens.)
_“I don’t know how much longer I can—\[static]. Go! And be careful—if Rocket knows you have interfered, you’re on their list now.”_
(The transmission cuts abruptly, replaced by dead air.)

# Act 3
## **Pewter City**
_The dirt path of Route 2 gives way to cobbled stone streets. Ahead, nestled against the base of the jagged gray cliffs, lies Pewter City. The air here feels heavier than Viridian — tinged with the earthy scent of rock and dust. Buildings of pale stone and timber rise around you, sturdy and unyielding like the mountains themselves._
_The streets are bustling— merchants calling out their wares, children darting between carts, a Machop hauling bricks for new construction. Yet there’s a tension beneath the noise. Conversations hush when you pass. A trainer at the gate argues with a guard about the museum being “closed again.” And from the north, you swear you feel a faint hum, carried on the wind — a vibration in your chest that shouldn’t be there._
_Towering above the city stands the Pewter Museum of Science, its banners bright against the stone facade: “Ancient Treasures of Kanto — Fossils, Meteorites, Wonders of the Earth.” But where you’d expect crowds, the museum steps are oddly empty, guarded by League men in crisp uniforms. Their eyes linger on you longer than is comfortable._
_Somewhere in the heart of the city, a Gym rests — the home of Brock, Pewter’s steadfast leader. But the whispers in the crowd tell you this city isn’t the safe, scholarly haven it should be. Something old has been uncovered. Something dangerous. And whether the people know it or not… all eyes are on the museum._

### 🎭 Atmosphere
- A city of stone and fossils, proud of its history but living in uneasy silence.
- Rumors spread: Pokémon freezing mid-command, Gym matches postponed, strange “vibrations” under the museum.
- Streets are busy, but every conversation has an edge — people know something’s wrong, even if they can’t explain it.

### 🏚️ Fossil Researcher’s Lodge (Top-Left Building, Pewter City)
_The small stone building sits half-sunk into the hillside, its roof patched with mismatched tiles. A crooked wooden sign dangles from the porch beam, painted with a rough sketch of a Kabuto shell._
_Inside, the air smells faintly of dust and old paper. The walls are lined with fossil diagrams, rock samples, and sketches pinned with string and nails. Tables are cluttered with cracked magnifying lenses, notebooks filled with frantic handwriting, and trays of half-cleaned fossils._
_A woman with short brown hair tied back beneath a scarf looks up from a cluttered desk, startled. Her coat is smudged with chalk and dust, and a pair of cracked goggles hang around her neck. She narrows her eyes before speaking, her tone sharp but cautious._

**Dr. Maren (NPC):**_“You’re not with the museum… and you don’t look like League either. What are you doing in my lodge?”_
NPC: Dr. Maren
- **Appearance:** Mid-30s, practical and tired-looking, hands calloused from field work. Clothes dusty and patched, but clearly once professional.
- **Personality:** Cautious, intelligent, bitter about the League’s politics. Passionate about fossils and history, and deeply suspicious of both Rocket and the League.
- **Hook:** She was once a junior researcher at the Pewter Museum, fired after she publicly questioned the League’s excavation permits at Mt. Moon.
Interactions
If the PCs **introduce themselves openly**, she relaxes and will engage:
- She admits she’s been tracking “strange resonance patterns” in fossil fragments.
- She shows the PCs a chalkboard sketch of a **spike in readings** that matches the hum they’ve felt near sync devices.
- She suspects fossils themselves may react to the **same signal powering Rocket’s shard tech**.
If the PCs **show her Hammond’s Fossil Fragment**:
- She immediately recognizes it.
- **Dr. Maren (excited, hushed):**“This isn’t just a fragment of Kabuto or Omanyte. Look at the lattice in the stone — these fractures aren’t natural. They vibrate… like they’re part of something larger.\
  If Rocket is experimenting with this… Mt. Moon isn’t just full of fossils. It’s full of keys. And they’re digging for them.”
Role in the Story
- **Lore Tie-In:** Links fossils → shard resonance → Mt. Moon → artifact hunt.
- **Future Hook:** If the PCs promise to keep her informed, she may become a **recurring ally** who deciphers Rocket’s fossil-based tech from afar.

### 🏛 Pewter Museum of Science & History

**Exterior:** Imposing stone facade, banners for “Treasures of Ancient Kanto.” Guards posted by the fossil wing.\
**Public Wing:** Fossils of Kabutops, Aerodactyl, meteorites. Crowds are smaller than usual, guards shooing away kids.\
**NPC:** Curator Hammond — polite but nervous.
- _If asked about disturbances:_ He plays it off like nothing is happening. Insight checks from the players may tell he is lying.

#### Restricted Basement (Main Quest Area):

_As you squeeze through the narrow crawlspace, the air grows colder. The faint scent of stone and dust gives way to something sharper — metallic, electric, almost like the air before a storm._
_You push aside a loose panel and drop quietly into a wide, dimly lit chamber. Stone fossils line the walls -- but the room feels wrong, warped by the thing pulsing at its heart._
_In the center, suspended by steel braces and a tangle of thick black cables, floats a jagged shard of obsidian. Its surface is carved with an ancient eye symbol, glowing faintly with a sickly violet-blue light. With each pulse, the stone floor trembles, and the hum crawls into your bones._
_You see two figures similar to those you saw in Professor Oak’s lab — one rummaging through crates, the other hunched over a desk littered with papers. But it’s the figure standing closest to the shard that freezes your breath:_
_Dressed in all black, taller and sharper in uniform, their eyes lit by the shard’s glow. Their voice cuts through the hum, cold and certain:_
**Rocket Leader:**_“So… the pests from Pallet made it this far. Oak’s little volunteers. I should thank you — the Professor’s data was useful, but seeing how his ‘chosen’ responded to the Eye? That’s the real experiment.”_
_The shard pulses again. Your Pokémon’s Poké Balls rattle faintly at your belts. The Rocket leader smiles._
**Rocket Leader:**_“You feel it, don’t you? The signal. The call. Soon, there’ll be no difference between wild or trained… every instinct rewritten, every mind in unison. And you? You’ll be the first to fall.”_
With that, the grunts snap to attention, Poké Balls in hand, as the shard flares with unnatural light.

##### 🌀 Aftermath of the Pewter Museum Basement Battle

_As Graveler collapses, its rocky hide cracks where the sync nodes had been drilled. Violet light leaks out like steam, then fades. The shard’s glow sputters violently — the pulse in the room skipping, breaking rhythm — before settling into a dim heartbeat._
_The cables go slack. The hum dies. It just sits there, quiet, like it’s waiting._
_As the last Rocket Pokémon falters, Silas Umbra snaps his fingers. The two grunts scramble to his side, battered but smirking._
**Silas (calm, venomous):** _“Children, you think this is a victory? All you’ve done is prove the Professor right. The shard resonates for you — it noticed you. And that means we’re closer to what we seek than ever.”_
_With that, Silas produces a small, disc-like device — a_ **_Teleport Resonator_**_. It hums unnaturally as he slams it into the ground. A wave of distorted light ripples outward, rattling your bones. The shard flares bright violet, responding to the pulse, and in an instant the Rockets are gone — swallowed by a shimmer of psychic static._
_The battle ends not with victory cheers, but with an ominous silence. The shard’s glow still pulses faintly in the center of the room, casting long shadows across cracked fossils and scattered debris._
- **Broken Device:** The remains of the Teleport Resonator lie sparking on the ground, partially fried by the shard’s energy. PCs can salvage it. Later study may reveal:
  - It was powered by frequencies similar to Psychic-type teleportation (link to Bull’s Abra subplot).
  - It wasn’t stable — even Rocket can’t control this tech perfectly.
- **The Shard:**
  - Touching it directly causes a psychic echo — visions of Pokémon moving in unnatural unison, a cavern filled with chanting signals, and a whisper that cuts through the players’ minds: _“Closer…”_
  - Any attempt to move the shard fails. It is fused to the basement floor by cables and crystalline roots, and removing it risks collapse.
- **Curator Hammond:** Emerging from a toppled storage closet, the flustered museum curator thanks the players breathlessly. He admits the shard was unearthed during renovations and hidden away in the basement, but Rocket discovered it first.

##### 🎁 Rewards

- **Broken Teleport Resonator** (evidence of Rocket’s tech and escape method).
- Each PC gains +1 Loyalty with their Pokémon for surviving the shard’s psychic pulses.

##### 🚪 Resolution

When the players resurface, Pewter feels quieter. The hum beneath the earth is gone, and Brock’s Pokémon respond with relief. He greets them with a solemn nod:

### 🏚️ The Museum Shed (Right of the Museum)

_Tucked against the museum’s outer wall is a squat wooden shed, its door half-hidden behind overgrown shrubs. The roof tiles are mismatched and a thin curl of dust drifts from a small vent in the side. A faded sign on the door reads in blocky handwriting:_
**_“Museum Storage — Authorized Staff Only.”_**
_The padlock on the front looks newer than the shed itself._
**DC 15 Sleight of Hand/STR check** to break in.
1. **Suspicious Storage**
   - Crates labeled with excavation sites: _“Mt. Moon — Site 3,”_ _“Route 4 Fossil Bed”_.
   - Inside one crate is broken excavation gear and a few **cracked Poké Balls** — clearly mishandled.
2. **Evidence of Rocket Tampering**
   - A corner crate inside is a burlap sack with strange **ash-colored soil** that doesn’t match Pewter’s rocky terrain (a clue Rocket’s been smuggling things in from elsewhere).
   - A **discarded Rocket glove** is stuffed under a shelf. Dusty, but the crimson “R” is still visible.

### 🪨 Pewter Gym
**Appearance:** Carved stone pillars, training pits, fossils in the walls.\
**NPC:** Brock is sitting at the top of the stairs up to the main battle ground — stern but visibly worried.
- Refuses Gym battle until museum is dealt with.
- Confides that Oak once visited the museum years ago, warning “that shard wasn’t safe here.”
- After the museum: challenges the PCs officially.

#### The Gym Confrontation
- The players arrive at the Pewter Gym, expecting a battle.
- Brock greets them, stone-faced: _“I know why you’re here. But until the museum situation is resolved, I won’t risk a League-sanctioned match. The badge can wait — people’s and pokemon’s safety can’t.”_
- While they talk, Billy and his rival crew are in the Gym, loudly arguing with a junior trainer. Billy is frustrated, saying _he doesn’t need Brock’s permission_ to go deal with the museum.

#### Billy’s Slip

- If the players interact (or even just eavesdrop), Billy smirks and lets it slip: _“Ha! You all talk about rules. I’ve been in that basement more times than Hammond himself. The place has a loose panel out back near the cliffs. Easy way in, if you’ve got the guts.”_

#### 🪨 Brock’s Aftermath Dialogue (Read-Aloud)

_Brock is waiting just outside the Gym when you return, arms crossed, a pair of Geodude floating loyally at his side. He studies each of you quietly, eyes narrowing as if weighing your strength. When he finally speaks, his voice is low, steady, but with a hard edge of respect._
**_Brock:_** _“I felt it the moment it stopped. The… pressure. Like the air itself was lighter. My Pokémon aren’t trembling anymore. Whatever you shut down down there—it mattered.”_
_He shakes his head, fists tightening at his sides._
**_Brock (cont.):_**_“The museum staff said the shard was unearthed by accident during renovations, but I don’t buy it. Team Rocket doesn’t just stumble into things like this—they knew exactly what they were looking for. That means the device in the basement was never the real prize… just a piece of something bigger.”_
_He exhales sharply, his eyes turning toward the east, where the jagged outline of Mt. Moon looms against the horizon._
**_Brock:_**_“Mt. Moon has always drawn people with… ambitions. Fossils, rare stones, old myths. But if Rocket is digging there—if they’re after more shards—then this is only the beginning. You’ve proven yourselves more than just volunteers. You’ve proven you can protect Kanto when it counts.”_
_Brock unclenches his fist, then offers you a warm, steady look—the weight of a Gym Leader recognizing your worth._
**_Brock (finishing):_**_“So here’s how this goes. You’ve shown me your courage — now show me your skill. Inside, you’ll face me and my team the way it’s always been done. If you can withstand Pewter’s strength, if you can prove your Pokémon are ready to fight alongside you, then the Boulder Badge is yours. Think of it as more than a battle. Think of it as your first real step into Kanto’s League. Come inside — let’s see what you’re made of.”_

#### **🎖 Gym Battle**
- **Format:** Brock + 2 trainees vs. PCs (4v5 balance, Brock has 2 out).
- **Mid-battle flavor:** Brock comments that his Pokémon “feel freer already” after the shard was disabled.
- **Reward:** Boulder Badge + TM Rock Tomb.

#### 🏅 After the Battle

Once the players win, Brock steps down from his platform, recalls his last Pokémon, and offers a deep nod of respect.
**Brock:**_“You’ve earned it. Not because you survived the shard — but because you stood here, in the arena, and fought with everything you had. That’s what makes a real trainer._”
He hands over the **Boulder Badge** and a **TM (Rock Tomb)**, his eyes serious again.
**Brock (final words):**_“Keep that strength close. Mt. Moon is waiting… and if Team Rocket is digging there, then you’re about to learn that the League challenge isn’t just about battles. It’s about protecting this world.”_

### **🗂️ Summary**

- **What players discover:** Rocket’s devices aren’t the _source_ — the **shards are**. Pokemon are being used as batteries. The stronger the Pokemon, the stronger the influence of the shard.
- **Big realization:** Ancient artifacts = the root of the sync signal. Rocket’s tech just amplifies them.
- **Narrative impact:** This transforms Rocket from “criminal gang with gadgets” to “villains trying to resurrect ancient control over Pokémon.”
- **Next breadcrumb:** Mt. Moon excavations → more shards, deeper truths about the Aether Eye.

### WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
Gin convinced the Mart owner to sell Mike some malfunctioned pokeballs. The group first went to the Gym and overhead billy talk about how to get to the basement. They then went to the Museum main entrance and looked around and talked to the curator then at night went behing the Museum and went in the basement. They defeated Team Rocket inside and discovered the shard and rocks gathered from Mt. Moon. Team Rocket escaped. They then went back outside and tried to go inside the Museum but it was closed. They broke inside with a high DC sleight of hand check and entered. They set off the alarms and the camera inside got clear view of them going through things behing the counter. They didn't find anything and escaped. They then went to the top-left building and knocked. The woman inside heard the gym alarm and hesitantly opened the door. The party tried to lie saying they didn't know what was going on at the museum but she saw right through them. She left her house and locked it and went to help with the investigation at the museum which was now swarming with cops. The party then went back to Brock's gym and it was empty except for Brock. Right as they were about to battle, a cop came in to tell Brock someone had broken into the museum. Brock left and said the battle would need to wait. The party decided to long rest at the gym and during the night, Billy's group comes in and rests there as well. In the morning, the group is woken by Brock and a League officer coming in and accusing the party of breaking in. At first they try to lie but then they tell the party that they have them on camera. Sawyer comes clean and tells them that they broke in trying to find out more after finding what they did in the basement. After several persuasion checks, the officer and brock believes them. Brock then tells them to battle Billys group for the chance at a badge. They defeat Billy's group and Brock and get the badges and TMs and money. Brock tells them the next step is Mt. Moon.

## Mt. Moon Arc
### Route 3

#### Wild Pokemon Table
Pidgey, Spearow, Jigglypuff, Sandshrew, Ekans, Magikarp

#### 🌙 Night Watch Event – _“The Stone Caravan”_

The party sets up camp on Route 3 for their first true rest after Pewter.
- The road is quiet, stars bright overhead. The distant mountains loom like shadows.
- Whoever is on **first watch** (or whoever you pick) makes a **Perception check (DC 12)**.
**On success:**They hear the _squeak… squeak…_ of a rusty wheel. Then hushed voices.\
**On failure:**They still see the group eventually, but only when the Rockets are much closer, giving less time to prepare.
What They See
Through the brush, 3–4 ragtag trainers are hauling a **wooden wheelbarrow stacked with jagged gray stones**, each faintly humming with resonance (foreshadowing Mt. Moon fossils/shards).
These aren’t Rockets—they look like ordinary travelers, students, or miners. But their unease is obvious.
- The stones pulse faint violet light every few seconds.
The trainers whisper nervously:
- “Careful with that one… they said it resonates more when it’s cracked…”
- “Why do we have to move these at night? Feels shady.”
- “Doesn’t matter. We need the money. They pay half up front, half when it’s delivered.”
**Player Choices**
- If they attack, the trainers panic and release Pokémon
- **Reward if victorious**:
  - Resonant Fossil Shards (weaker than the Pewter shard, but useful).
- If the PCs hide (Group Stealth check DC 12): The trainers pass without noticing.
- They overhear key info:
  - “What are they doing at Mt. Moon anyways? Why do they want these stones in there? Did you see the weird lights from just inside the cave?”

### Mt. Moon
# Special Items/Pokemon

## Broken Neural Resonator from Route 22

- _A thin disc of polished black metal etched with micro-runes. A cracked crystal core is embedded at the center. Gives off a small hum. Has a dial on the bottom side._

- When studied (downtime or lab access), grants insight into the sync tech:

  - **+1 to Technology or Arcana checks** relating to Team Rocket devices when referenced.

  - Can be rebuilt with rare materials (future sidequest).

If the players give it to a knowledgeable NPC (like Juniper or Bill later), they may decode:

“This design... it’s old. Pre-Foundation. They were trying to induce sync without consent. Like flipping a switch in the brain.”


## Rattata

- Currently owned by Mike, **TR-W12 is on its paw.**

💥 Unique Move: Neural Fangs _(Replaces Hyper Fang)_

**Type: Dark\
&#x20;Category: Physical\
&#x20;Power: 50\
&#x20;Accuracy: 95%\
&#x20;Effect: On a hit, roll a d6:**

- **1–2: Target loses Reaction this round.**

- **3–4: Target has Disadvantage on next Save.**

- **5–6: Target becomes Confused (1 round).**

**_Cooldown:_ Usable once every 2 rounds.**

- **Flavored as: The Rattata’s bite hits a nerve cluster, sending a ripple of psychic feedback through the opponent. A remnant of sync testing — not natural instinct.**

🧬 Long-Term Evolution Hook:

**If the player keeps the Rattata and bonds with it:**

- **You could let it evolve into a unique “Syncratic Raticate” — a custom form with residual Rocket influence, a built-in resistance to mind-altering effects, and psychic-patterned fur.**

- **It could later gain access to a psychic or dark-type signature move unlocked only by sync exposure.**


# **Glossary**

## **THE BIG PICTURE: How It's All Connected**

🧠 1. Modern Neural Sync Tech

What Oak, the League, and Rocket are using now.
- **Purpose (Original):** Help trainers and Pokémon better understand each other — empathy-based bonding tech.
- **Purpose (Now):** Covertly test **direct control** over Pokémon instincts (obedience, aggression, fear suppression).
- **Tools Involved:**
  - Earpieces, control tags, collars, modified Poké Balls.
  - Pokémon like Rattata and Butterfree have been **"partial sync test subjects."**
🧩 What the Players Have Encountered:
- Oak’s **research was stolen** to accelerate this tech.
- Team Rocket’s raid used Pokémon pre-conditioned through this tech (Koffing, Vileplume, maybe even Sandshrew).
- Butterfree was Subject 8 — it **rejected the sync mid-test**, causing instability.
- The Sync Dampener Band is a **countermeasure**.
🧬 2. The Signal
An ambient psychic field that players may hear referred to as “the hum,” “the resonance,” or “the tether.”
- When players get near “nodes” or corrupted Pokémon, it **feels like a presence**.
- The sync tech taps into this **signal** — but no one fully understands what it is yet.
- It predates modern technology.
**Analogy:** Sync tech is like building a radio. The **signal** is the strange, ancient broadcast it tunes into.
🧿 3. The Artifact — “The Aether Eye” or Origin Node
Ancient device. The source of the signal.
- Buried or sealed long ago — possibly due to the danger it posed.
- It **generates the signal** that modern sync tech piggybacks on.
- It is rumored to **store consciousness**, override free will, and link minds — not just Pokémon, but humans too.
- Team Rocket wants to find it and use it to **overwrite** the League, the wilds, even key trainers.
🧠 So in Timeline Form:
1. **Ancient Civilization** created the Aether Eye or similar artifacts to spiritually/mentally sync with Pokémon.
2. It went too far — control and consciousness override occurred — and it was sealed or lost.
3. **The League’s early researchers (Oak, Blaine, Cedar)** rediscovered psychic signal echoes in Pokémon behavior.
4. **Oak** wanted to help trainer bonds; **Rocket** wanted control.
5. **Current Rocket tests** use modern devices to copy what the artifact could do naturally.
6. Your players are **seeing the fallout** — Pokémon breaking down, going rogue, syncing halfway… or waking up.

## Ancient Artifact
**Name**: **The Aether Eye\
Appearance**: A crystalline orb set in an obsidian root-like base. When active, it emits a pulse like a heartbeat.\
**Effect**: In ancient times, it was said to bring absolute peace between Pokémon and people — but also **remove all free will**.
- Rocket thinks they can use it to **create the perfect Pokémon army**.
- But the Eye doesn’t just sync minds — it **stores them**.
- There may be **spirits or echoes of ancient trainers** still trapped in its signal…

## Neural Sync Data
**Neural Sync Data** is a classified research project developed by Professor Oak, exploring how a Pokémon’s brain activity can **synchronize** with a human’s—creating temporary emotional, sensory, or even psychic bonds.
Think **Pokémon empathy + remote link + battle cognition**, a precursor to things like:
- Mega Evolution bonds
- Aura sync (e.g. with Lucario)
- Latent psychic potential in trainers

### **Why It’s Valuable (to Oak and Team Rocket)**
- Oak developed it as a way to **understand Pokémon on a deeper level**—empathy-driven training and conservation.
- **Team Rocket** wants it for the **exact opposite**: to hijack those connections and **control Pokémon behavior**, or possibly even override trainer loyalty using artificial synchronization.
- The sync logs include **genetic markers**, **emotional imprinting data**, and **brainwave frequency profiles**—specifically from:
  - Psychic types like **Abra**
  - Emotionally bonded Pokémon like **Eevee**
  - Genetically interesting subjects like **Bellsprout** or **Growlithe**

### **Possible Long-Term Twists**
- **Bull’s Abra** may have been a **prototype sync subject**—his affinity for machines might be linked to a past test run involving neural links.
- **Gin** might be naturally compatible with sync tech due to **Giovanni’s psychic-adjacent bloodline**, making him a target (or the only one who can finish Oak’s work).
- **Sawyer's Flicker** (Eevee) might have already undergone an early sync trial—hence why she was marked for recovery by Rocket.

### **How You Can Use It:**
- Fragments of the data can be recovered in later sessions: encrypted logs, EEG readouts, psychic wave scanners.
- Oak’s research could be split into **modules** Team Rocket is chasing across Kanto (good reason to travel from town to town).
- Eventually, you could give one PC the ability to **briefly sync** with a Pokémon in a clutch moment—maybe during a boss battle or a legendary encounter.
